I joined the CoBrA lab as a Research Assistant in October 2016. I completed my undergraduate studies at McGill University in physiology with a minor in psychology. I’ve pursued a variety of interests, from Drosophila neurobiology research to volunteering abroad. I’m currently working on the Alzheimer’s Disease Biomarkers project, which allows me to combine my interest in neuroscience and psychology with my passion of working with people. 

Outside of my academic and research pursuits, I love to travel, go camping as well as cook and eat amazing food.
