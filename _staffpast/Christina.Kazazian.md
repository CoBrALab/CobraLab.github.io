Christina joined the lab as a research assistant in May 2019 after completing her M.Sc. in Neuroscience at McGill, and her B.Sc. in Behavioural Neuroscience and Multidisciplinary Sciences at Concordia. For her M.Sc. thesis, she explored Central Auditory Processing as a possible marker for disease progression in Alzheimer’s.


Christina is now helping Saashi run the MAGeT Brain pipeline to segment the subcortical structures and hippocampus in a large autism MRI dataset. She is also helping the lab’s collaborators at PREVENT-AD part-time.


Outside the lab, you can find her with her nose in a book or spending quality time with her dog.
