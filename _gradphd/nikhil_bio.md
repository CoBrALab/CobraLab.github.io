I am a PhD student at the CoBrA lab with a joint affiliation with the University of Toronto. I completed my Bachelor’s and Master’s programs in Electrical Engineering at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, specializing in signal processing and communication networks. After my Master’s, I worked in the industry for two years at Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs in Paris, France, and Intelligent Automation Inc. in Rockville, Maryland. Currently I am working on developing novel biomakers and prognostic applications for neurodegenerative disorders using machine-learning techniques. Specifically, I am working on application of artificial neural network models towards MR imaging data for predicting clinical symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease. Broadly my research interests include computational neuroscience, machine-learning, signal processing, and related areas.

In my free time, I enjoy playing a few sports - tennis, soccer, and badminton and backpacking around the world.
