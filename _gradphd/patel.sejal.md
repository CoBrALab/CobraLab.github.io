I am currently a PhD student at CobraLab. I completed my undergraduate degree at University of Toronto, specializing in Neuroscience. I continued following my interest in neurogenetics and completed my Master’s in human disease genetics at University College London where I became interested in bioinformatics. Currently I am working on different bioinformatic approaches combining genetic and imaging data to investigate and identify novel biomarkers in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.
In my spare time I enjoy running, soccer and reading. I have a huge sweet tooth and enjoy
making different desserts.
