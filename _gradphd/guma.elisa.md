I joined the Cobra lab in January 2016 as a PhD candidate in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience (IPN) at McGill University. I completed my undergrad at Dickinson College, a liberal arts school in Carlisle, PA, where I majored in neuroscience. I then went on to do my master’s degree at McGill in the IPN program, under the supervision of Dr. Bruno Giros. I studied the effects of chronic antipsychotic treatment on mouse brain volume as well as neuronal and glial cell density. With the use of transgenic mice, I was able to investigate the role of the D2 and D3 dopamine receptors.  In the Cobra lab I plan to investigate the neuroanatomical phenotypes of risk and resilience in the development of neuropsychiatric disease in both mice and humans. Some fun facts about me are that I’ve grown up in six different countries, and when I’m not doing science, I like to draw and paint.
