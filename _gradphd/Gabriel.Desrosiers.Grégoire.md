Gabriel joined the CoBrA lab in 2017 as an undergraduate student in neuroscience. He pursued a one year undergraduate research project supervised by Elisa Guma where he studied the impact of maternal immune activation during gestation on the structural development of the embryonic brain.

He pursued his studies in the lab in 2018 and is now a PhD student, where his work focuses on the development of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in mice to study the global organization of brain activity. In particular, he studies the impact of anesthetic regimens on brain activity and the neurovascular coupling of the fMRI signal, how we can measure functional coupling between brain regions, and how brain dynamics can be related to underlying biological structures, such as gene expression structure and white matter connectivity.

Outside of lab work, Gabriel is an avid runner and coffee drinker. He also enjoys stimulating discussions, movies and music.
