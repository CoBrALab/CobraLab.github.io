Aurélie joined the CobraLab in January 2019 in order to do her PhD. She previously completed two Master’s degrees, one in Neuroscience and one in Medical Bio-Imaging at the University of Bordeaux in France.

Her main interest is to evaluate and identify volumetric and microstructural modifications in the hippocampal subfields during healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease progression with MRI techniques. Her goal is to contribute towards improving our understanding of hippocampal alterations and the detection of early biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.

In her free time, Aurélie likes to travel and explore new countries, play cello in orchestra, and hike.
