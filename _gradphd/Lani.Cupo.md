Lani joined the lab in June, 2019 after completing a Bachelor's degree in Theater and 
Cognitive Science from Occidental College (Los Angeles, USA) and a year of rotations in McGill's IPN. 
Her project employs magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy to investigate the effects of prenatal 
stressors (maternal immune activation, THC exposure) on mouse neurodevelopment, with a focus on how 
they may contribute to disorders, such as schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorders.

When she is not in the lab, Lani can be found pursuing her passions for writing, singing, and baking!
