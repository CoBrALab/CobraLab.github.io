Daniel joined the lab as a research assistant in 2015 to help realize the lab's preclinical research branch. Coming from a background in radiation biology and cancer research, he brings experience in animal handling, genetics and biochemical science to the CoBrA Lab. Along with providing support for ongoing animal projects and collaborations, he serves as the lab's small animal MRI operator, quartermaster and walking Wikipedia. As a personal project, Daniel investigates deep brain stimulation as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's Disease, and has constructed MRI-compatible, carbon-based electrodes to use in his experiments.

In his spare time Daniel enjoys lifting things up and putting them down, running a DnD campaign, meme farming and expanding his repertoire of puns.
