Gabriel comes to the CoBrA Lab from an Engineering Physics doctorate at McMaster University. At McMaster he grew thin film crystals and nanostructures and characterized them X-Ray crystallography amongst other techniques. As part of his experimental work he also developed X-ray data processing tools and crystallography models.

During his time at McMaster he became involved in Software Carpentry Organization (http://software-carpentry.org/), became a certified instructor. He now regularly teaches two day workshops where research scientists learn the basics of reproducible computation and software engineering to get more done in less time, and with less pain. Gabriel is the maintainer of the core Software Carpentry lessons on the Unix Shell. Gabriel has also taught undergraduate university courses on Numerical Computation and Material Science.
