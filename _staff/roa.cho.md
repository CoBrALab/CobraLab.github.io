I joined the CoBrA Lab as a research assistant in October 2016. I am currently involved in a project which studies how deep brain stimulation affects human brain structure in Alzheimerâ€™s Disease.

I completed my BSc at McGill University in physiology with a minor in physics. I ended up with a wide variety of research interests, ranging from pathophysiology to astrobiology. My previous research experience includes advanced microscopy and microbiology within the framework of proving motility as a sign of life.

My hobbies include golfing during the summer and hibernating during winter. I also like to knit, sew and so all sorts of crafty things.
