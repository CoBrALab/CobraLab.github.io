Joseph joined the lab as a research assistant in November 2020 after completing his
undergraduate degree in psychology from the American University of Beirut, Lebanon.

Joseph has previously worked on different research projects such as investigating intergroup
relations between refugees and the host community in Lebanon, and his senior year
proposal investigating the role of food scarcity on neural-face processing and discrimination.
He also has experience working in psychiatric services.

Joseph is currently helping with a project examining the risk factors for psychosis by
comparing cognitive and MRI data of patients at high-risk for psychosis. He is also
responsible for the administrative tasks at the lab.

Outside the lab, you can find him reading a book, at the gym, or playing the guitar.
