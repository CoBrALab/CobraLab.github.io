Saashi joined the CoBrA lab as a research assistant in January 2015, during which time she helped coordinate the [Healthy Aging study](http://cobralab.ca/projects/healthy-aging/). She then completed her MSc in McGill’s Integrated Program in Neuroscience in the lab. For her MSc thesis she investigated heterogeneity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by examining alterations in cortical thickness, with a specific focus on the impact of sex, age, and IQ, using a large, multi-site structural MRI dataset. 

Saashi is now coordinating a new study in the lab investigating risk factors for psychosis, in collaboration with the Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychosis (PEPP) at the Douglas Institute. She is also working on extending her master’s work to investigate examine alterations in the subcortical structures and hippocampus in ASD in the same dataset. 

Outside of the lab, you can find Saashi biking, rock climbing, or eating chocolate.
