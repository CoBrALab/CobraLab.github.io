title: Parsing disease heterogeneity

In neuroimaging research many typically ask the question: how are these brain different from one another.
However, given the development and dissemination of large publicly available datasets, we are now able to ask more complex questions about the nature of neuropsychiatric disorders and their neuroanatomical signatures.
Most of these disorders are exceptionally heterogeneous in their symptomatology and in their pathological burden.
Our goal is to better understand the relationship between this heterogeneity in order to better elucidate factors that are associated with risk and resilience to neuropsychiatric disorders.
Projects under this theme are currently ongoing in the study of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
