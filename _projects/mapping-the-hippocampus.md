title: Mapping the hippocampus and it's subfields and the memory network 
layout: pagenonav

Our group has done significant work in the development of novel automated techniques for mapping the hippocampus and it's subfields (Winterburn et al., NeuroImage, 2013; Pipitone et al., NeuroImage, 2014).
We have a developed a suite of detailed atlases that demonstrate the anatomy and architecture of this morphologically complex region of the brain.
This work is currently being used to study healthy ageing and the hippocampus in the context of different neuropsychiatric disorders (see also: [atlas pages](/atlases)).
