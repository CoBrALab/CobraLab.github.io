For decades, deep brain stimulation, a therapy that involves the surgical implantation of an electrode that provides electrical stimulation to deficient brain circuits has been used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
However, prior to the wide-spread usage of this therapy it was heavily experimented in preclinical experiments.
Our goal is to better understand the brain plasticity mediated by deep brain stimulation (in clinical and preclinical experiments) that may make it an effective treatment in other neuropsychiatric disorders.
