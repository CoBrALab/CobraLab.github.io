Gulebru joined the CoBra lab as a postdoctoral fellow in February 2016. Her work will focus on how deep brain stimulation shapes the molecular and structural architecture of the brain, using mouse as a model.

She received her PhD in Behavioural Neurosciences at University of Strasbourg in France under the supervision of Pr. Brigitte Kieffer. Her graduate studies at Institute of Genetics and Molecular and Cellular Biology (IGBMC) focused on a mouse model of protracted drug abstinence, combining various behavioural, pharmacological and histological techniques to explore the opioid system. She spent the last year of her PhD at Douglas Mental Health University Institute in Montreal where she worked on her side project on profiling microRNAs of the mouse brain.

In her spare time, she tries to be a cinephile.
