I joined CobraLab as a Reseach Assistant in September 2014. I graduated from the University of Toronto, with a double specialist in Pharmacology and Biomedical Toxicology, and a minor in German Studies. I am interested in identifying how brain circuits are neuroanatomically and functionally remodelled in response to deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the fornix in rodent models, using behavioural analyses and high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 

I enjoyed learning languages and exploring different neighbourhoods for good food, coffee and beer.  I have a soft spot for 85% dark chocolate.
