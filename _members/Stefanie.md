I'm doing my master's in biology with a major in neuroscience at ETH Zurich and currently a proud member of the Cobra Lab. That said, I'm particular interested in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Disease (PD). During my work here I will analyze data from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (For further information please have a look at: www.ppmi-info.org). 

When I"m not in the lab you might see me doing Insaity in the park and eating a big chocolate bar afterwards.
