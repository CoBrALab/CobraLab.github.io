Matt joined the CoBrA Lab in 2012 as a Research Assistant. He started pursuing his MD at the Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University in 2014, while starting part-time work as a Research Associate.

Since joining the lab, he worked on development of automatic segmentation algorithms for the cerebellum and hippocampus (using MAGeT Brain), and is applying these methods in a number of studies. His primary interests are in child 
psychiatric disorders (autism spectrum disorders, ADHD) and Parkinson's disease, and using computational brain mapping to examine anatomical alterations in such disorders. He is currently working towards improving existing 
pipelines for automated segmentation of the cerebellum.
