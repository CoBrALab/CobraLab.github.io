Vivian joined the CoBrA lab during the winter of 2015 as a Research Assistant. She is interested in atlasing the hippocampus subfields in a variety of images using her knowledge of computational neuroanatomy and MRI scans. She hopes to put together different image types in mass to assess subfields in a variety of populations (such as schizophrenia datasets, aging, Alzheimerâ€™s etc).
She is currently an undergraduate student at McGill University pursuing a degree in Biochemistry.
