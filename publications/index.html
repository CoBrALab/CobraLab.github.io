<blockquote><p>Using neuroimaging technologies to elucidate the relationship
  between genotype and phenotype and brain and behavior will be a key
  contribution to biomedical research in the twenty-first century. Among the
  many methods for analyzing neuroimaging data, image registration deserves
  particular attention due to its wide range of applications. Finding
  strategies to register together many images and analyze the differences
  between them can be a challenge, particularly given that different
  experimental designs require different registration strategies. Moreover,
  writing software that can handle different types of image registration
  pipelines in a flexible, reusable and extensible way can be challenging. In
  response to this challenge, we have created Pydpiper, a neuroimaging
  registration toolkit written in Python. Pydpiper is an open-source, freely
  available software package that provides multiple modules for various image
  registration applications. Pydpiper offers five key innovations.
  Specifically: (1) a robust file handling class that allows access to outputs
  from all stages of registration at any point in the pipeline; (2) the ability
  of the framework to eliminate duplicate stages; (3) reusable, easy to
  subclass modules; (4) a development toolkit written for non-developers; (5)
  four complete applications that run complex image registration pipelines
  "out-of-the-box." In this paper, we will discuss both the general Pydpiper
  framework and the various ways in which component modules can be pieced
  together to easily create new registration pipelines. This will include a
  discussion of the core principles motivating code development and a
  comparison of Pydpiper with other available toolkits. We also provide a
  comprehensive, line-by-line example to orient users with limited programming
  knowledge and highlight some of the most useful features of Pydpiper. In
  addition, we will present the four current applications of the
  code.</p></blockquote></li>

White matter lesion filling improves the accuracy of cortical thickness
  measurements in multiple sclerosis patients: a longitudinal study.
<cite>BMC Neurosci</cite>, 15:106, 2014.
[PubMed
  Central:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4164794">PMC4164794</a>]
  [DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2202-15-106">10.1186/1471-2202-15-106</a>]
  [PubMed:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25200127">25200127</a>].
<blockquote><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that white matter (WM)
  lesions bias automated brain tissue classifications and cerebral volume
  measurements. However, filling WM lesions using the intensity of neighbouring
  normal-appearing WM has been shown to increase the accuracy of automated
  volume measurements in the brain. In the present study, we investigate the
  influence of WM lesions on cortical thickness (CTh) measures and assessed the
  impact of lesion filling on both cross-sectional/longitudinal and
  global/regional measurements of CTh in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.
  Fifty MS patients were studied at baseline as well as after three and six
  years of follow-up. CTh was estimated using a fully automated pipeline
  (CIVET) on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images data acquired at 1.5 Tesla
  without (original) and with WM lesion filling (filled). WM lesions were
  semi-automatically segmented and then filled with the mean intensity of the
  neighbouring voxels. For both original and filled T1 images we investigated
  and compared the main CIVET's steps: tissue classification, surfaces
  generation and CTh measurement.On the original T1 images, the majority of
  WM lesion volume (72%) was wrongly classified as gray matter (GM). After
  lesion filling the accuracy of WM lesions classification improved
  significantly (p < 0.001, 94% of WM lesion volume correctly classified) as
  well as the WM surface generation (p < 0.0001). The mean CTh computed on the
  original T1 images, overall time points, was significantly thinner (p <
  0.001) compared the CTh estimated on the filled T1 images. The vertex-wise
  longitudinal analysis performed on the filled T1 images showed an increased
  number of vertices in the fronto-temporal region with a significantly
  decrease of CTh over time compared the analysis performed on the original
  images.These results indicate that WM lesions bias the CTh estimation both
  cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally. The lesion filling approach
  significantly improved the accuracy of the regional CTh estimation and has an
  impact also on the global estimation of CTh.</p></blockquote></li>

Multi-atlas segmentation of the whole hippocampus and subfields using
  multiple automatically generated templates.
<cite>Neuroimage</cite>, 101:494–512, Nov 2014.
[DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.04.054">10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.04.054</a>]
  [PubMed:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24784800">24784800</a>].
<blockquote><p>Advances in image segmentation of magnetic resonance images
  (MRI) have demonstrated that multi-atlas approaches improve segmentation over
  regular atlas-based approaches. These approaches often rely on a large number
  of manually segmented atlases (e.g. 30-80) that take significant time and
  expertise to produce. We present an algorithm, MAGeT-Brain (Multiple
  Automatically Generated Templates), for the automatic segmentation of the
  hippocampus that minimises the number of atlases needed whilst still
  achieving similar agreement to multi-atlas approaches. Thus, our method acts
  as a reliable multi-atlas approach when using special or hard-to-define
  atlases that are laborious to construct.MAGeT-Brain works by propagating
  atlas segmentations to a template library, formed from a subset of target
  images, via transformations estimated by nonlinear image registration. The
  resulting segmentations are then propagated to each target image and fused
  using a label fusion method. We conduct two separate Monte Carlo
  cross-validation experiments comparing MAGeT-Brain and basic multi-atlas
  whole hippocampal segmentation using differing atlas and template library
  sizes, and registration and label fusion methods. The first experiment is a
  10-fold validation (per parameter setting) over 60 subjects taken from the
  Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Database (ADNI), and the second is a
  five-fold validation over 81 subjects having had a first episode of
  psychosis. In both cases, automated segmentations are compared with manual
  segmentations following the Pruessner-protocol. Using the best settings found
  from these experiments, we segment 246 images of the ADNI1:Complete 1Yr 1.5T
  dataset and compare these with segmentations from existing automated and
  semi-automated methods: FSL FIRST, FreeSurfer, MAPER, and SNT. Finally, we
  conduct a leave-one-out cross-validation of hippocampal subfield segmentation
  in standard 3T T1-weighted images, using five high-resolution manually
  segmented atlases (Winterburn et al., 2013).In the ADNI cross-validation,
  using 9 atlases MAGeT-Brain achieves a mean Dice's Similarity Coefficient
  (DSC) score of 0.869 with respect to manual whole hippocampus segmentations,
  and also exhibits significantly lower variability in DSC scores than
  multi-atlas segmentation. In the younger, psychosis dataset, MAGeT-Brain
  achieves a mean DSC score of 0.892 and produces volumes which agree with
  manual segmentation volumes better than those produced by the FreeSurfer and
  FSL FIRST methods (mean difference in volume: 80mm(3), 1600mm(3), and
  800mm(3), respectively). Similarly, in the ADNI1:Complete 1Yr 1.5T dataset,
  MAGeT-Brain produces hippocampal segmentations well correlated (r>0.85) with
  SNT semi-automated reference volumes within disease categories, and shows a
  conservative bias and a mean difference in volume of 250mm(3) across the
  entire dataset, compared with FreeSurfer and FSL FIRST which both
  overestimate volume differences by 2600mm(3) and 2800mm(3) on average,
  respectively. Finally, MAGeT-Brain segments the CA1, CA4/DG and subiculum
  subfields on standard 3T T1-weighted resolution images with DSC overlap
  scores of 0.56, 0.65, and 0.58, respectively, relative to manual
  segmentations.We demonstrate that MAGeT-Brain produces consistent whole
  hippocampal segmentations using only 9 atlases, or fewer, with various
  hippocampal definitions, disease populations, and image acquisition types.
  Additionally, we show that MAGeT-Brain identifies hippocampal subfields in
  standard 3T T1-weighted images with overlap scores comparable to competing
  methods.</p></blockquote></li>

Resting-state networks link invasive and noninvasive brain stimulation
  across diverse psychiatric and neurological diseases.
<cite>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.</cite>, Sep 2014.
[DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1405003111">10.1073/pnas.1405003111</a>]
  [PubMed:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25267639">25267639</a>].
<blockquote><p>Brain stimulation, a therapy increasingly used for neurological
  and psychiatric disease, traditionally is divided into invasive approaches,
  such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), and noninvasive approaches, such as
  transcranial magnetic stimulation. The relationship between these approaches
  is unknown, therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear, and the ideal stimulation
  site for a given technique is often ambiguous, limiting optimization of the
  stimulation and its application in further disorders. In this article, we
  identify diseases treated with both types of stimulation, list the
  stimulation sites thought to be most effective in each disease, and test the
  hypothesis that these sites are different nodes within the same brain network
  as defined by resting-state functional-connectivity MRI. Sites where DBS was
  effective were functionally connected to sites where noninvasive brain
  stimulation was effective across diseases including depression, Parkinson's
  disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder, essential tremor, addiction, pain,
  minimally conscious states, and Alzheimer's disease. A lack of functional
  connectivity identified sites where stimulation was ineffective, and the sign
  of the correlation related to whether excitatory or inhibitory noninvasive
  stimulation was found clinically effective. These results suggest that
  resting-state functional connectivity may be useful for translating therapy
  between stimulation modalities, optimizing treatment, and identifying new
  stimulation targets. More broadly, this work supports a network perspective
  toward understanding and treating neuropsychiatric disease, highlighting the
  therapeutic potential of targeted brain network
  modulation.</p></blockquote></li>

Illness denial in schizophrenia spectrum disorders: A function of left
  hemisphere dominance.
<cite>Hum Brain Mapp</cite>, Sep 2014.
[DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hbm.22624">10.1002/hbm.22624</a>]
  [PubMed:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25209949">25209949</a>].
<blockquote><p>Impaired illness awareness or anosognosia is a common, but
  poorly understood feature of schizophrenia that contributes to medication
  nonadherence and poor treatment outcomes. Here we present a functional
  imaging study to measure brain activity at the moment of illness denial. To
  accomplish this, participants with schizophrenia (n = 18) with varying
  degrees of illness awareness were confronted with their illness beliefs while
  undergoing functional MRI. To link structure with function, we explored the
  relationships among impaired illness awareness and brain activity during the
  illness denial task with cortical thickness. Impaired illness awareness was
  associated with increased brain activity in the left temporoparieto-occipital
  junction (TPO) and left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) at the moment of
  illness denial. Brain activity in the left mPFC appeared to be a function of
  participants' degree of self-reflectiveness, while the activity in the left
  TPO was associated with cortical thinning in this region and more specific to
  illness denial. Participants with impaired illness awareness had slower
  response times to illness related stimuli than those with good illness
  awareness. Increased left hemisphere brain activity in association with
  illness denial is consistent with the literature in other neuropsychiatric
  conditions attributing anosognosia or impaired illness awareness to left
  hemisphere dominance. The TPO and mPFC may represent putative targets for
  noninvasive treatment interventions, such as transcranial magnetic or direct
  current stimulation. Hum Brain Mapp, 2014. Â© 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Label-fusion-segmentation and deformation-based shape analysis of deep gray
  matter in multiple sclerosis: the impact of thalamic subnuclei on
  disability.
<cite>Hum Brain Mapp</cite>, 35(8):4193–4203, Aug 2014.
[DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hbm.22470">10.1002/hbm.22470</a>]
  [PubMed:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510715">24510715</a>].
<blockquote><p>Deep gray matter (DGM) atrophy has been reported in patients
  with multiple sclerosis (MS) already at early stages of the disease and
  progresses throughout the disease course. We studied DGM volume and shape and
  their relation to disability in a large cohort of clinically well-described
  MS patients using new subcortical segmentation methods and shape analysis.
  Structural 3D magnetic resonance images were acquired at 1.5 T in 118
  patients with relapsing remitting MS. Subcortical structures were segmented
  using a multiatlas technique that relies on the generation of an
  automatically generated template library. To localize focal morphological
  changes, shape analysis was performed by estimating the vertex-wise
  displacements each subject must undergo to deform to a template. Multiple
  linear regression analysis showed that the volume of specific thalamic nuclei
  (the ventral nuclear complex) together with normalized gray matter volume
  explains a relatively large proportion of expanded disability status scale
  (EDSS) variability. The deformation-based displacement analysis confirmed the
  relation between thalamic shape and EDSS scores. Furthermore, white matter
  lesion volume was found to relate to the shape of all subcortical structures.
  This novel method for the analysis of subcortical volume and shape allows
  depicting specific contributions of DGM abnormalities to neurological
  deficits in MS patients. The results stress the importance of ventral
  thalamic nuclei in this respect.</p></blockquote></li>

Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in schizophrenia: A review.
<cite>Eur Neuropsychopharmacol</cite>, Aug 2014.
[DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.euroneuro.2014.07.015">10.1016/j.euroneuro.2014.07.015</a>]
  [PubMed:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25159198">25159198</a>].
<blockquote><p>Findings from neuroimaging studies in patients with
  schizophrenia suggest widespread structural changes although the mechanisms
  through which these changes occur are currently unknown. Glutamatergic
  activity appears to be increased in the early phases of schizophrenia and may
  contribute to these structural alterations through an excitotoxic effect. The
  primary aim of this review was to describe the possible role of
  glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in explaining the presence of
  neuroanatomical changes within schizophrenia. A Medline(ÃÂ®) literature
  search was conducted, identifying English language studies on the topic of
  glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in schizophrenia, using the terms
  "schizophreni(Ã¢ÂÅ½)" and "glutam(Ã¢ÂÅ½)" and (("MRS" or "MRI"
  or "magnetic resonance") or ("computed tomography" or "CT")). Studies
  concomitantly investigating glutamatergic activity and brain structure in
  patients with schizophrenia were included. Results are discussed in the
  context of findings from preclinical studies. Seven studies were identified
  that met the inclusion criteria. These studies provide inconclusive support
  for the role of glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in the occurrence of
  structural changes within schizophrenia, with the caveat that there is a
  paucity of human studies investigating this topic. Preclinical data suggest
  that an excitotoxic effect may occur as a result of a paradoxical increase in
  glutamatergic activity following N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor hypofunction.
  Based on animal literature, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity may account for
  certain structural changes present in schizophrenia, but additional human
  studies are required to substantiate these findings. Future studies should
  adopt a longitudinal design and employ magnetic resonance imaging techniques
  to investigate whether an association between glutamatergic activity and
  structural changes exists in patients with
  schizophrenia.</p></blockquote></li>

Self-injurious behaviours are associated with alterations in the
  somatosensory system in children with autism spectrum disorder.
<cite>Brain Struct Funct</cite>, 219(4):1251–1261, Jul 2014.
[DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00429-013-0562-2">10.1007/s00429-013-0562-2</a>]
  [PubMed:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23644587">23644587</a>].
<blockquote><p>Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently engage
  in self-injurious behaviours, often in the absence of reporting pain.
  Previous research suggests that altered pain sensitivity and repeated
  exposure to noxious stimuli are associated with morphological changes in
  somatosensory and limbic cortices. Further evidence from postmortem studies
  with self-injurious adults has indicated alterations in the structure and
  organization of the temporal lobes; however, the effect of self-injurious
  behaviour on cortical development in children with ASD has not yet been
  determined. Thirty children and adolescents (mean age = 10.6 Â± 2.5 years;
  range 7-15 years; 29 males) with a clinical diagnosis of ASD and 30 typically
  developing children (N = 30, mean age = 10.7 Â± 2.5 years; range 7-15
  years, 26 males) underwent T1-weighted magnetic resonance and diffusion
  tensor imaging. No between-group differences were seen in cerebral volume,
  surface area or cortical thickness. Within the ASD group, self-injury scores
  negatively correlated with thickness in the right superior parietal lobule t
  = 6.3, p < 0.0001, bilateral primary somatosensory cortices (SI) (right: t =
  4.4, p = 0.02; left: t = 4.48, p = 0.004) and the volume of the left
  ventroposterior (VP) nucleus of the thalamus (r = -0.52, p = 0.008). Based on
  these findings, we performed an atlas-based region-of-interest diffusion
  tensor imaging analysis between SI and the VP nucleus and found that children
  who engaged in self-injury had significantly lower fractional anisotropy (r =
  -0.4, p = 0.04) and higher mean diffusivity (r = 0.5, p = 0.03) values in the
  territory of the left posterior limb of the internal capsule. Additionally,
  greater incidence of self-injury was associated with increased radial
  diffusivity values in bilateral posterior limbs of the internal capsule
  (left: r = 0.5, p = 0.02; right: r = 0.5, p = 0.009) and corona radiata
  (left: r = 0.6, p = 0.005; right: r = 0.5, p = 0.009). Results indicate that
  self-injury is related to alterations in somatosensory cortical and
  subcortical regions and their supporting white-matter pathways. Findings
  could reflect use-dependent plasticity in the somatosensory system or
  disrupted brain development that could serve as a risk marker for
  self-injury.</p></blockquote></li>

Striatal Morphology is Associated with Tobacco Cigarette Craving.
<cite>Neuropsychopharmacology</cite>, Jul 2014.
[DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/npp.2014.185">10.1038/npp.2014.185</a>]
  [PubMed:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25056595">25056595</a>].
<blockquote><p>The striatum has a clear role in addictive disorders and is
  involved in drug-related craving. Recently, enhanced striatal volume was
  associated with greater lifetime nicotine exposure, suggesting a bridge
  between striatal function and structural phenotypes. To assess this link
  between striatal structure and function, we evaluated the relationship
  between striatal morphology and this brain region's well-established role in
  craving. In tobacco smokers, we assessed striatal volume, surface area, and
  shape using a new segmentation methodology coupled with local shape indices.
  Striatal morphology was then related with two measures of craving:
  state-based craving, assessed by the brief questionnaire of smoking urges
  (QSU), and craving induced by smoking-related images. A positive association
  was found between left striatal volume and surface area with both measures of
  craving. A more specific relationship was found between both craving measures
  and the dorsal, but not in ventral striatum. Evaluating dorsal striatal
  subregions showed a single relationship between the caudate and QSU. Although
  cue-induced craving and the QSU were both associated with enlarged striatal
  volume and surface area, these measures were differentially associated with
  global or more local striatal volumes. We also report a connection between
  greater right striatal shape deformations and cue-induced craving. Shape
  deformations associated with cue-induced craving were specific to striatal
  subregions involved in habitual responding to rewarding stimuli, which is
  relevant given the habitual nature of cue-induced craving. The current
  findings confirm a relationship between striatal function and morphology and
  suggest that variation in striatal morphology may be a biomarker for craving
  severity.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 20 August 2014;

Identifying craniofacial features associated with prenatal exposure to
  androgens and testing their relationship with brain development.
<cite>Brain Struct Funct</cite>, Jul 2014.
[DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00429-014-0852-3">10.1007/s00429-014-0852-3</a>]
  [PubMed:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25074752">25074752</a>].
<blockquote><p>We used magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained in same-sex and
  opposite-sex dizygotic twins (n = 119, 8 years of age) to study possible
  effects of prenatal androgens on craniofacial features. Using a principal
  component analysis of 19 craniofacial landmarks placed on the MR images, we
  identified a principal component capturing craniofacial features that
  distinguished females with a presumed differential exposure to prenatal
  androgens by virtue of having a male (vs. a female) co-twin (Cohen's d =
  0.76). Subsequently, we tested the possibility that this craniofacial
  "signature" of prenatal exposure to androgens predicts brain size, a known
  sexually dimorphic trait. In an independent sample of female adolescents
  (singletons; n = 462), we found that the facial signature predicts up to 8   of variance in brain size. These findings are consistent with the
  organizational effects of androgens on brain development and suggest that the
  facial signature derived in this study could complement other indirect
  measures of prenatal exposure to androgens.</p></blockquote></li>

Derivation of high-resolution MRI atlases of the human cerebellum at
  3T and segmentation using multiple automatically generated templates.
<cite>Neuroimage</cite>, 95:217–231, Jul 2014.

<blockquote><p>The cerebellum has classically been linked to motor learning and
  coordination. However, there is renewed interest in the role of the
  cerebellum in non-motor functions such as cognition and in the context of
  different neuropsychiatric disorders. The contribution of neuroimaging
  studies to advancing understanding of cerebellar structure and function has
  been limited, partly due to the cerebellum being understudied as a result of
  contrast and resolution limitations of standard structural magnetic resonance
  images (MRI). These limitations inhibit proper visualization of the highly
  compact and detailed cerebellar foliations. In addition, there is a lack of
  robust algorithms that automatically and reliably identify the cerebellum and
  its subregions, further complicating the design of large-scale studies of the
  cerebellum. As such, automated segmentation of the cerebellar lobules would
  allow detailed population studies of the cerebellum and its subregions. In
  this manuscript, we describe a novel set of high-resolution in vivo atlases
  of the cerebellum developed by pairing MR imaging with a carefully validated
  manual segmentation protocol. Using these cerebellar atlases as inputs, we
  validate a novel automated segmentation algorithm that takes advantage of the
  neuroanatomical variability that exists in a given population under study in
  order to automatically identify the cerebellum, and its lobules. Our
  automatic segmentation results demonstrate good accuracy in the
  identification of all lobules (mean Kappa [ÃÂº]=0.731; range 0.40-0.89),
  and the entire cerebellum (mean ÃÂº=0.925; range 0.90-0.94) when
  compared to "gold-standard" manual segmentations. These results compare
  favorably in comparison to other publically available methods for automatic
  segmentation of the cerebellum. The completed cerebellar atlases are
  available freely online (http://imaging-genetics.camh.ca/cerebellum) and can
  be customized to the unique neuroanatomy of different subjects using the
  proposed segmentation pipeline

Mapping the development of the basal ganglia in children with
  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
<cite>J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry</cite>, 53(7):780–789, Jul 2014.
[DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2014.05.003">10.1016/j.jaac.2014.05.003</a>]
  [PubMed:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24954827">24954827</a>].
<blockquote><p>The basal ganglia are implicated in the pathophysiology of
  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but little is known of their
  development in the disorder. Here, we mapped basal ganglia development from
  childhood into late adolescence using methods that define surface morphology
  with an exquisite level of spatial resolution.Surface morphology of the
  basal ganglia was defined from neuroanatomic magnetic resonance images
  acquired in 270 youth with DSM-IV-defined ADHD and 270 age- and sex-matched
  typically developing controls; 220 individuals were scanned at least twice.
  Using linear mixed model regression, we mapped developmental trajectories
  from age 4 through 19 years at approximately 7,500 surface vertices in the
  striatum and globus pallidus.In the ventral striatal surfaces, there was a
  diagnostic difference in developmental trajectories (t = 5.6, p < .0001).
  Here, the typically developing group showed surface area expansion with age
  (estimated rate of increase of 0.54 mm(2) per year, standard error [SE] 0.29
  mm(2) per year), whereas the ADHD group showed progressive contraction
  (decrease of 1.75 mm(2) per year, SE 0.28 mm(2) per year). The ADHD group
  also showed significant, fixed surface area reductions in dorsal striatal
  regions, which were detected in childhood at study entry and persisted into
  adolescence. There was no significant association between history of
  psychostimulant treatment and developmental trajectories.Progressive,
  atypical contraction of the ventral striatal surfaces characterizes ADHD,
  localizing to regions pivotal in reward processing. This contrasts with
  fixed, nonprogressive contraction of dorsal striatal surfaces in regions that
  support executive function and motor planning.</p></blockquote></li>

Illness Progression, Recent Stress, and Morphometry of Hippocampal
  Subfields and Medial Prefrontal Cortex in Major Depression.
<cite>Biol. Psychiatry</cite>, Jul 2014.
[DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.06.018">10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.06.018</a>]
  [PubMed:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25109665">25109665</a>].
<blockquote><p>Longitudinal studies of illness progression in patients with
  major depressive disorder (MDD) indicate that the onset of subsequent
  depressive episodes becomes increasingly decoupled from external stressors. A
  possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon is that multiple episodes
  induce long-lasting neurobiological changes that confer increased risk for
  recurrence. Prior morphometric studies have frequently reported volumetric
  reductions in patients with MDD-especially in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
  and the hippocampus-but few studies have investigated whether these changes
  are exacerbated by prior episodes.In a sample of 103 medication-free
  patients with depression and control subjects with no history of depression,
  structural magnetic resonance imaging was performed to examine relationships
  between number of prior episodes, current stress, hippocampal subfield volume
  and cortical thickness. Volumetric analyses of the hippocampus were performed
  using a recently validated subfield segmentation approach, and cortical
  thickness estimates were obtained using vertex-based methods. Participants
  were grouped on the basis of the number of prior depressive episodes and
  current depressive diagnosis.Number of prior episodes was associated with
  both lower reported stress levels and reduced volume in the dentate gyrus.
  Cortical thinning of the left mPFC was associated with a greater number of
  prior depressive episodes but not current depressive diagnosis.
  Collectively, these findings are consistent with preclinical models
  suggesting that the dentate gyrus and mPFC are especially vulnerable to
  stress exposure and provide evidence for morphometric changes that are
  consistent with stress-sensitization models of recurrence in
  MDD.</p></blockquote></li>

Disrupted prefrontal interhemispheric structural coupling in schizophrenia
  related to working memory performance.
<cite>Schizophr Bull</cite>, 40(4):914–924, Jul 2014.

<blockquote><p>Prominent regional cortical thickness reductions have been shown
  in schizophrenia. In contrast, little is known regarding alterations of
  structural coupling between regions in schizophrenia and how these
  alterations may be related to cognitive impairments in this disorder.
  T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired in 54 patients with
  schizophrenia and 68 healthy control subjects aged 18-55 years. Cortical
  thickness was compared between groups using a vertex-wise approach. To assess
  structural coupling, seeds were selected within regions of reduced thickness,
  and brain-wide cortical thickness correlations were compared between groups.
  The relationships between identified patterns of circuit structure disruption
  and cognitive task performance were then explored.Prominent cortical
  thickness reductions were found in patients compared with controls at a 5  false discovery rate in a predominantly frontal and temporal pattern.
  Correlations of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with right
  prefrontal regions were significantly different in patients and controls. The
  difference remained significant in a subset of 20 first-episode patients.
  Participants with stronger frontal interhemispheric thickness correlations
  had poorer working memory performance.We identified structural impairment
  in a left-right DLPFC circuit in patients with schizophrenia independent of
  illness stage or medication exposure. The relationship between left-right
  DLPFC thickness correlations and working memory performance implicates
  prefrontal interhemispheric circuit impairment as a vulnerability pathway for
  poor working memory performance. Our findings could guide the development of
  novel therapeutic interventions aimed at improving working memory performance
  in patients with schizophrenia.</p></blockquote></li>

Estimating volumes of the pituitary gland from T1-weighted
  magnetic-resonance images: effects of age, puberty, testosterone, and
  estradiol.
<cite>Neuroimage</cite>, 94:216–221, Jul 2014.
[DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.02.030">10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.02.030</a>]
  [PubMed:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632090">24632090</a>].
<blockquote><p>The pituitary gland is a key structure in the
  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis–it plays an important role in
  sexual maturation during puberty. Despite its small size, its volume can be
  quantified using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here, we study a cohort of
  962 typically developing adolescents from the Saguenay Youth Study and
  estimate pituitary volumes using a newly developed multi-atlas segmentation
  method known as the MAGeT Brain algorithm. We found that age and puberty
  stage (controlled for age) each predicts adjusted pituitary volumes
  (controlled for total brain volume) in both males and females. Controlling
  for the effects of age and puberty stage, total testosterone and estradiol
  levels also predict adjusted pituitary volumes in males and pre-menarche
  females, respectively. These findings demonstrate that the pituitary gland
  grows during adolescence, and its volume relates to circulating plasma-levels
  of sex steroids in both males and females.</p></blockquote></li>

  institutions worldwide. Organized into Working Groups that tackle questions
  in neuroscience, genetics, and medicine, ENIGMA studies have analyzed
  neuroimaging data from over 12,826 subjects. In addition, data from 12,171
  individuals were provided by the CHARGE consortium for replication of
  findings, in a total of 24,997 subjects. By meta-analyzing results from many
  sites, ENIGMA has detected factors that affect the brain that no individual
  site could detect on its own, and that require larger numbers of subjects
  than any individual neuroimaging study has currently collected. ENIGMA's
  first project was a genome-wide association study identifying common variants
  in the genome associated with hippocampal volume or intracranial volume.
  Continuing work is exploring genetic associations with subcortical volumes
  (ENIGMA2) and white matter microstructure (ENIGMA-DTI). Working groups also
  focus on understanding how schizophrenia, bipolar illness, major depression
  and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affect the brain. We
  review the current progress of the ENIGMA Consortium, along with challenges
  and unexpected discoveries made on the way.</p></blockquote></li>

Multi-contrast unbiased MRI atlas of a Parkinson's disease

<blockquote><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second leading neurodegenerative
  disease after Alzheimer's disease. In PD research and its surgical treatment,
  such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), anatomical structural identification
  and references for spatial normalization are essential, and human brain
  atlases/templates are proven highly instrumental. However, two shortcomings
  affect current templates used for PD. First, many templates are derived from
  a single healthy subject that is not sufficiently representative of the
  PD-population anatomy. This may result in suboptimal surgical plans for DBS
  surgery and biased analysis for morphological studies. Second, commonly used
  mono-contrast templates lack sufficient image contrast for some subcortical
  structures (i.e., subthalamic nucleus) and biochemical information (i.e.,
  iron content), a valuable feature in current PD research.We employed a
  novel T1-T2* fusion MRI that visualizes both cortical and subcortical
  structures to drive groupwise registration to create co-registered
  multi-contrast (T1w, T2*w, T1-T2* fusion, phase, and an R2* map) unbiased
  templates from 15 PD patients, and a high-resolution histology-derived 3D
  atlas is co-registered. For validation, these templates are compared against
  the Colin27 template for landmark registration and midbrain nuclei
  segmentation.While the T1w, T2*w, and T1-T2* fusion templates provide
  excellent anatomical details for both cortical and subcortical structures,
  the phase and R2* map contain the biochemical features. By one-way ANOVA
  tests, our templates significantly ([Formula: see text]) outperform the
  Colin27 template in the registration-based tasks.The proposed unbiased
  templates are more representative of the population of interest and can
  benefit both the surgical planning and research of PD.</p></blockquote></li>

Cortical morphology in children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental

<blockquote><p>It is well established that individuals exposed to alcohol in
  utero have reduced cortical grey matter volumes. However, the candidate
  determinants of these reductions, cortical thickness (CT) and surface area
  (SA), have not been investigated exclusively in alcohol-related
  neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), the most prevalent fetal alcohol spectrum
  disorder subgroup that lacks the characteristic facial dysmorphology.
  T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 88
  participants (8-16 years), 36 diagnosed with ARND and 52 typically developing
  controls. Scans were submitted to the CIVET pipeline (version 1.1.10).
  Deformable models were used to construct the inner white matter surfaces and
  pial surfaces from which CT and SA measures were derived. Group differences
  in cortical volume, CT, and SA were computed using a general linear model
  covaried for age, sex, and handedness.Global cortical volume reductions in
  ARND did not reflect CT, which did not differ between groups. Instead, volume
  decreases were consistent with global SA reductions in bilateral frontal and
  temporal as well as right occipital regions. Local reductions in SA were
  observed in the right superior temporal gyrus and the right
  occipital-temporal region.Results suggest that in ARND, prenatal alcohol
  exposure perturbs global SA to a greater degree than CT, particularly in the
  right temporal lobe.</p></blockquote></li>

Longitudinal four-dimensional mapping of subcortical anatomy in human

<blockquote><p>Growing access to large-scale longitudinal structural
  neuroimaging data has fundamentally altered our understanding of cortical
  development en route to human adulthood, with consequences for basic science,
  medicine, and public policy. In striking contrast, basic anatomical
  development of subcortical structures such as the striatum, pallidum, and
  thalamus has remained poorly described–despite these evolutionarily ancient
  structures being both intimate working partners of the cortical sheet and
  critical to diverse developmentally emergent skills and disorders. Here, to
  begin addressing this disparity, we apply methods for the measurement of
  subcortical volume and shape to 1,171 longitudinally acquired structural
  magnetic resonance imaging brain scans from 618 typically developing males
  and females aged 5-25 y. We show that the striatum, pallidum, and thalamus
  each follow curvilinear trajectories of volume change, which, for the
  striatum and thalamus, peak after cortical volume has already begun to
  decline and show a relative delay in males. Four-dimensional mapping of
  subcortical shape reveals that (i) striatal, pallidal, and thalamic domains
  linked to specific fronto-parietal association cortices contract with age
  whereas other subcortical territories expand, and (ii) each structure harbors
  hotspots of sexually dimorphic change over adolescence–with relevance for
  sex-biased mental disorders emerging in youth. By establishing the
  developmental dynamism, spatial heterochonicity, and sexual dimorphism of
  human subcortical maturation, these data bring our spatiotemporal
  understanding of subcortical development closer to that of the
  cortex–allowing evolutionary, basic, and clinical neuroscience to be
  conducted within a more comprehensive developmental
  framework.</p></blockquote></li>

Gray- and White-Matter Anatomy of Absolute Pitch Possessors.

<blockquote><p>Absolute pitch (AP), the ability to identify a musical pitch
  without a reference, has been examined behaviorally in numerous studies for
  more than a century, yet only a few studies have examined the neuroanatomical
  correlates of AP. Here, we used MRI and diffusion tensor imaging to
  investigate structural differences in brains of musicians with and without
  AP, by means of whole-brain vertex-wise cortical thickness (CT) analysis and
  tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis. APs displayed increased CT in
  a number of areas including the bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG), the
  left inferior frontal gyrus, and the right supramarginal gyrus. Furthermore,
  we found higher fractional anisotropy in APs within the path of the inferior
  fronto-occipital fasciculus, the uncinate fasciculus, and the inferior
  longitudinal fasciculus. The findings in gray matter support previous studies
  indicating an increased left lateralized posterior STG in APs, yet they
  differ from previous findings of thinner cortex for a number of areas in APs.
  Finally, we found a relation between the white-matter results and the CT in
  the right parahippocampal gyrus. In this study, we present novel findings in
  AP research that may have implications for the understanding of the
  neuroanatomical underpinnings of AP ability.</p></blockquote></li>

Mapping registration sensitivity in MR mouse brain images.
<cite>Neuroimage</cite>, 82:226–236, Nov 2013.
[DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.06.004">10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.06.004</a>]
  [PubMed:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23756204">23756204</a>].
<blockquote><p>Nonlinear registration algorithms provide a way to estimate
  structural (brain) differences based on magnetic resonance images. Their
  ability to align images of different individuals and across modalities has
  been well-researched, but the bounds of their sensitivity with respect to the
  recovery of salient morphological differences between groups are unclear.
  Here we develop a novel approach to simulate deformations on MR brain images
  to evaluate the ability of two registration algorithms to extract structural
  differences corresponding to biologically plausible atrophy and expansion. We
  show that at a neuroanatomical level registration accuracy is influenced by
  the size and compactness of structures, but do so differently depending on
  how much change is simulated. The size of structures has a small influence on
  the recovered accuracy. There is a trend for larger structures to be
  recovered more accurately, which becomes only significant as the amount of
  simulated change is large. More compact structures can be recovered more
  accurately regardless of the amount of simulated change. Both tested
  algorithms underestimate the full extent of the simulated atrophy and
  expansion. Finally we show that when multiple comparisons are corrected for
  at a voxelwise level, a very low rate of false positives is obtained. More
  interesting is that true positive rates average around 40%, indicating that
  the simulated changes are not fully recovered. Simulation experiments were
  run using two fundamentally different registration algorithms and we
  identified the same results, suggesting that our findings are generalizable
  across different classes of nonlinear registration
  algorithms.</p></blockquote></li>

Performing label-fusion-based segmentation using multiple automatically

<cite>Hum Brain Mapp</cite>, 34(10):2635–2654, Oct 2013.
[DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hbm.22092">10.1002/hbm.22092</a>]
  [PubMed:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22611030">22611030</a>].
<blockquote><p>Classically, model-based segmentation procedures match magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI) volumes to an expertly labeled atlas using nonlinear
  registration. The accuracy of these techniques are limited due to atlas
  biases, misregistration, and resampling error. Multi-atlas-based approaches
  are used as a remedy and involve matching each subject to a number of
  manually labeled templates. This approach yields numerous independent
  segmentations that are fused using a voxel-by-voxel label-voting procedure.
  In this article, we demonstrate how the multi-atlas approach can be extended
  to work with input atlases that are unique and extremely time consuming to
  construct by generating a library of multiple automatically generated
  templates of different brains (MAGeT Brain). We demonstrate the efficacy of
  our method for the mouse and human using two different nonlinear registration
  algorithms (ANIMAL and ANTs). The input atlases consist a high-resolution
  mouse brain atlas and an atlas of the human basal ganglia and thalamus
  derived from serial histological data. MAGeT Brain segmentation improves the
  identification of the mouse anterior commissure (mean Dice Kappa values
  (ÃÂº = 0.801), but may be encountering a ceiling effect for hippocampal
  segmentations. Applying MAGeT Brain to human subcortical structures improves
  segmentation accuracy for all structures compared to regular model-based
  techniques (ÃÂº = 0.845, 0.752, and 0.861 for the striatum, globus
  pallidus, and thalamus, respectively). Experiments performed with three
  manually derived input templates suggest that MAGeT Brain can approach or
  exceed the accuracy of multi-atlas label-fusion segmentation (ÃÂº =
  0.894, 0.815, and 0.895 for the striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus,
  respectively).</p></blockquote></li>

Does skull shape mediate the relationship between objective features and
  subjective impressions about the face?
<cite>Neuroimage</cite>, 79:234–240, Oct 2013.
[DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.04.110">10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.04.110</a>]
  [PubMed:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23651841">23651841</a>].
<blockquote><p>In our previous work, we described facial features associated
  with a successful recognition of the sex of the face (MareÃÂkovÃÂ¡
  et al., 2011). These features were based on landmarks placed on the surface
  of faces reconstructed from magnetic resonance (MR) images; their position
  was therefore influenced by both soft tissue (fat and muscle) and bone
  structure of the skull. Here, we ask whether bone structure has dissociable
  influences on observers' identification of the sex of the face. To answer
  this question, we used a novel method of studying skull morphology using MR
  images and explored the relationship between skull features, facial features,
  and sex recognition in a large sample of adolescents (n=876; including 475
  adolescents from our original report). To determine whether skull features
  mediate the relationship between facial features and identification accuracy,
  we performed mediation analysis using bootstrapping. In males, skull features
  mediated fully the relationship between facial features and sex judgments. In
  females, the skull mediated this relationship only after adjusting facial
  features for the amount of body fat (estimated with bioimpedance). While body
  fat had a very slight positive influence on correct sex judgments about male
  faces, there was a robust negative influence of body fat on the correct sex
  judgments about female faces. Overall, these results suggest that
  craniofacial bone structure is essential for correct sex judgments about a
  male face. In females, body fat influences negatively the accuracy of sex
  judgments, and craniofacial bone structure alone cannot explain the
  relationship between facial features and identification of a face as
  female.</p></blockquote></li>

Alterations of superficial white matter in schizophrenia and relationship to

<blockquote><p>Post-mortem studies have demonstrated alterations in superficial
  white matter (SWM) in schizophrenia patients. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
  can be used to assess SWM in vivo, and compare SWM fractional anisotropy (FA)
  in schizophrenia patients vs healthy controls. The assessment of SWM in vivo
  also provides an opportunity to identify novel neural correlates of cognitive
  performance, and potential cognitive impairment in schizophrenia patients.
  Forty-four patients with schizophrenia and 44 matched healthy controls
  underwent neuroimaging and cognitive protocols. Using an SWM mask and
  tract-based spatial statistics, differences in SWM-FA were examined between
  groups. SWM-FA clusters different between groups were then used to predict
  cognitive performance with multiple linear regression. The relative
  contribution of SWM fiber subtypes (deep white matter extensions vs U-fibers
  and intraregional fibers) from significantly different clusters was examined.
  Compared to controls, patients with schizophrenia had reduced FA in five SWM
  clusters: the largest a left posterior parieto-occipital cluster, followed by
  four clusters in the left frontal lobe. SWM-FA in the frontal lobe clusters
  predicted attention, working memory, and processing speed performance in
  healthy controls, but not in patients with schizophrenia. The majority of
  streamlines tracked from these clusters were restricted to U-fibers and
  intraregional fibers, rather than deep white matter extensions. Our analyses
  revealed prominent SWM disruption in patients with schizophrenia compared to
  controls. SWM-cognition relationships shown in healthy individuals were
  disrupted in patients with schizophrenia. SWM may be an important
  neurobiological substrate of cognitive performance and a novel cortical
  treatment target for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia
  patients.</p></blockquote></li>

<blockquote><p>Oligodendrocyte genes and white matter tracts have been
  implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and may play an important
  etiopathogenic role in cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. The objective
  of the present study in 60 chronic schizophrenia patients individually
  matched to 60 healthy controls was to determine whether 1) white matter tract
  integrity influences cognitive performance, 2) oligodendrocyte gene variants
  influence white matter tract integrity and cognitive performance, and 3)
  effects of oligodendrocyte gene variants on cognitive performance are
  mediated via white matter tract integrity. We used the partial least-squares
  multivariate approach to ascertain relationships among oligodendrocyte gene
  variants, integrity of cortico-cortical and subcortico-cortical white matter
  tracts, and cognitive performance. Robust relationships among oligodendrocyte
  gene variants, white matter tract integrity, and cognitive performance were
  found in both patients and controls. We also showed that effects of gene
  variants on cognitive performance were mediated by the integrity of white
  matter tracts. Our results were strengthened by bioinformatic analyses of
  gene variant function. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has
  brought together these lines of investigation in the same population and
  highlights the importance of the oligodendrocyte/white matter pathway in
  schizophrenia, particularly as it pertains to cognitive
  function.</p></blockquote></li>

A novel in vivo atlas of human hippocampal subfields using high-resolution 3

<cite>Neuroimage</cite>, 74:254–265, Jul 2013.

  [PubMed:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23415948">23415948</a>].
<blockquote><p>The hippocampus is a neuroanatomical structure that has been
  widely studied in the context of learning, memory, stress, and
  neurodegeneration. Neuroanatomically, the hippocampus is subdivided into
  several subfields with intricate morphologies and complex three-dimensional
  relationships. Recent studies have demonstrated that the identification of
  different subfields is possible with high-resolution and -contrast image
  volumes acquired using ex vivo specimens in a small bore 9.4 T scanner and,
  more recently, in vivo, at 7 T. In these studies, the neuroanatomical
  definitions of boundaries between subfields are based upon salient
  differences in image contrast. Typically, the definition of subfields has not
  been possible using commonly available magnetic resonance (MR) scanners
  (i.e.: 1.5 or 3T) due to resolution and contrast limitations. To overcome the
  limited availability of post-mortem specimens and expertise in
  state-of-the-art high-field imaging, we propose a coupling of MR acquisition
  and detailed segmentation techniques that allow for the reliable
  identification of hippocampal anatomy (including subfields). High-resolution
  and -contrast T1- and T2-weighted image volumes were acquired from 5
  volunteers (2 male; 3 female; age range: 29-57, avg. 37) using a clinical
  research-grade 3T scanner and have final super-sampled isotropic voxel
  dimensions of 0.3mm. We demonstrate that by using these acquisition
  techniques, our data results in contrast-to-noise ratios that compare well
  with high-resolution images acquired with long scan times using post-mortem
  data at higher field strengths. For the subfields, the cornus ammonis (CA) 1,
  CA2/CA3, CA4/dentate gyrus, stratum radiatum/stratum lacunosum/stratum
  moleculare, and subiculum were all labeled as separate structures.
  Hippocampal volumes are reported for each of the substructures and the
  hippocampus as a whole (range for hippocampus: 2456.72-3325.02 mm(3)).
  Intra-rater reliability of our manual segmentation protocol demonstrates high
  reliability for the whole hippocampus (mean Dice Kappa of 0.91; range
  0.90-0.92) and for each of the subfields (range of Dice Kappas: 0.64-0.83).
  We demonstrate that our reliability is better than the Dice Kappas produced
  by simulating the following errors: a translation by a single voxel in all
  cardinal directions and 1% volumetric shrinkage and expansion. The completed
  hippocampal atlases are available freely online
  (info2.camh.net/kf-tigr/index.php/Hippocampus) and can be coupled with novel
  computational neuroanatomy techniques that will allow for them to be
  customized to the unique neuroanatomy of different subjects, and ultimately
  be utilized in different analysis pipelines.</p></blockquote></li>

<blockquote><p>Lack of illness awareness or anosognosia occurs in both
  schizophrenia and right hemisphere lesions due to stroke, dementia, and
  traumatic brain injury. In the latter conditions, anosognosia is thought to
  arise from unilateral hemispheric dysfunction or interhemispheric
  disequilibrium, which provides an anatomical model for exploring illness
  unawareness in other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia.
  Both voxel-based morphometry using Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration
  through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL) and a deformation-based morphology
  analysis of hemispheric asymmetry were performed on 52 treated schizophrenia
  subjects, exploring the relationship between illness awareness and gray
  matter volume. Analyses included age, gender, and total intracranial volume
  as covariates.Hemispheric asymmetry analyses revealed illness unawareness
  was significantly associated with right < left hemisphere volumes in the
  anteroinferior temporal lobe (t = 4.83, P = 0.051) using DARTEL, and the
  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (t = 5.80, P = 0.003) and parietal lobe (t =
  4.3, P = 0.050) using the deformation-based approach. Trend level
  associations were identified in the right medial prefrontal cortex (t = 4.49,
  P = 0.127) using DARTEL. Lack of illness awareness was also strongly
  associated with reduced total white matter volume (r = 0.401, P < 0.01) and
  illness severity (r = 0.559, P < 0.01).These results suggest a
  relationship between anosognosia and hemispheric asymmetry in schizophrenia,
  supporting previous volume-based MRI studies in schizophrenia that found a
  relationship between illness unawareness and reduced right hemisphere gray
  matter volume. Functional imaging studies are required to examine the neural
  mechanisms contributing to these structural
  observations.</p></blockquote></li>

FTO, obesity and the adolescent brain.

<blockquote><p>Genetic variations in fat mass- and obesity (FTO)-associated
  gene, a well-replicated gene locus of obesity, appear to be associated also
  with reduced regional brain volumes in elderly. Here, we examined whether FTO
  is associated with total brain volume in adolescence, thus exploring possible
  developmental effects of FTO. We studied a population-based sample of 598
  adolescents recruited from the French Canadian founder population in whom we
  measured brain volume by magnetic resonance imaging. Total fat mass was
  assessed with bioimpedance and body mass index was determined with
  anthropometry. Genotype-phenotype associations were tested with Merlin under
  an additive model. We found that the G allele of FTO (rs9930333) was
  associated with higher total body fat [TBF (P = 0.002) and lower brain volume
  (P = 0.005)]. The same allele was also associated with higher lean body mass
  (P = 0.03) and no difference in height (P = 0.99). Principal component
  analysis identified a shared inverse variance between the brain volume and
  TBF, which was associated with FTO at P = 5.5 Ã 10(-6). These results were
  replicated in two independent samples of 413 and 718 adolescents, and in a
  meta-analysis of all three samples (n = 1729 adolescents), FTO was associated
  with this shared inverse variance at P = 1.3 Ã 10(-9). Co-expression
  networks analysis supported the possibility that the underlying FTO effects
  may occur during embryogenesis. In conclusion, FTO is associated with shared
  inverse variance between body adiposity and brain volume, suggesting that
  this gene may exert inverse effects on adipose and brain tissues. Given the
  completion of the overall brain growth in early childhood, these effects may
  have their origins during early development.</p></blockquote></li>

Adolescent cocaine exposure causes enduring macroscale changes in mouse

<blockquote><p>Cocaine dependence is associated with abnormalities in brain
  structure in humans. However, it is unclear whether these differences in
  brain structure predispose an individual to drug use or are a result of
  cocaine's action on the brain. This study investigates the impact of chronic
  cocaine exposure on brain structure and drug-related behavior in mice.
  Specifically, mice received daily cocaine or saline injections for 20 d
  during two developmental time periods: adolescence (27-46 d old) and young
  adulthood (60-79 d old). Following 30 d of abstinence, either fixed brain T2
  weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired on a 7 T scanner at 32
  ÃÂ¼m isotropic voxel dimensions or mice were assessed for sensitization
  to the locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine. Three automated techniques
  (deformation-based morphometry, striatum shape analysis, and cortical
  thickness assessment) were used to identify population differences in brain
  structure in cocaine-exposed versus saline-exposed mice. We found that
  cocaine induced changes in brain structure, and these were most pronounced in
  mice exposed to cocaine during adolescence. Many of these changes occurred in
  brain regions previously implicated in addiction including the nucleus
  accumbens, striatum, insular cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and medial
  forebrain bundle. Furthermore, exposure to the same cocaine regimen caused
  sensitization to the locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine, and these
  effects were again more pronounced in mice exposed to cocaine during
  adolescence. These results suggest that altered brain structure following 1
  month of abstinence may contribute to these persistent drug-related
  behaviors, and identify cocaine exposure as the cause of these morphological
  changes.</p></blockquote></li>

DISC1 and Striatal Volume: A Potential Risk Phenotype

<blockquote><p>Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 was originally discovered in a
  large Scottish family with abnormally high rates of severe mental illness,
  including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. An accumulating
  body of evidence from genetic, postmortem, and animal data supports a role
  for DISC1 in different forms of mental illness. DISC1 may play an important
  role in determining structure and function of several brain regions. One
  brain region of particular importance for several mental disorders is the
  striatum, and DISC1 mutant mice have demonstrated an increase in dopamine
  (D2) receptors in this structure. However, association between DISC1
  functional polymorphisms and striatal structure have not been examined in
  humans. We, therefore hypothesized that there would be a relationship between
  human striatal volume and DISC1 genotype, specifically in the Leu607Phe
  (rs6675281) and Ser704Cys (rs821618) single nucleotide polymorphisms. We
  tested our hypothesis by automatically identifying the striatum in 54 healthy
  volunteers recruited for this study. We also performed an exploratory
  analysis of cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and structure volume.
  Our results demonstrate that Phe allele carriers have larger striatal volume
  bilaterally (left striatum: p = 0.017; right striatum: p = 0.016). From the
  exploratory analyses we found that the Phe carriers also had larger left
  hemisphere volumes (p = 0.0074) and right occipital lobe surface area (p =
  0.014) compared to LeuLeu homozygotes. However, these exploratory findings do
  not survive a conservative correction for multiple comparisons. Our findings
  demonstrate that a functional DISC1 variant influences striatal volumes.
  Taken together with animal data that this gene influences D2 receptor levels
  in striatum, a key risk pathway for mental illnesses such as schizophrenia
  and bipolar disorder may be conferred via DISC1's effects on the
  striatum.</p></blockquote></li>

<blockquote><p>The most dramatic growth of the human brain occurs in utero and
  during the first 2 years of postnatal life. Genesis of the cerebral cortex
  involves cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, all of which may be
  influenced by prenatal environment. Here, we show that variation in KCTD8
  (potassium channel tetramerization domain 8) is associated with brain size in
  female adolescents (rs716890, P = 5.40 Ã 10(-09)). Furthermore, we found
  that the KCTD8 locus interacts with prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette
  smoking vis-Ã -vis cortical area and cortical folding: In exposed girls
  only, the KCTD8 locus explains up to 21% of variance. Using head
  circumference as a proxy of brain size at 7 years of age, we have replicated
  this gene-environment interaction in an independent sample. We speculate that
  KCTD8 might modulate adverse effects of smoking during pregnancy on brain
  development via apoptosis triggered by low intracellular levels of potassium,
  possibly reducing the number of progenitor cells.</p></blockquote></li>

An anatomically comprehensive atlas of the adult human brain transcriptome.

<blockquote><p>Neuroanatomically precise, genome-wide maps of transcript
  distributions are critical resources to complement genomic sequence data and
  to correlate functional and genetic brain architecture. Here we describe the
  generation and analysis of a transcriptional atlas of the adult human brain,
  comprising extensive histological analysis and comprehensive microarray
  profiling of Ã¢ËÂ¼900 neuroanatomically precise subdivisions in two
  individuals. Transcriptional regulation varies enormously by anatomical
  location, with different regions and their constituent cell types displaying
  robust molecular signatures that are highly conserved between individuals.
  Analysis of differential gene expression and gene co-expression relationships
  demonstrates that brain-wide variation strongly reflects the distributions of
  major cell classes such as neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and
  microglia. Local neighbourhood relationships between fine anatomical
  subdivisions are associated with discrete neuronal subtypes and genes
  involved with synaptic transmission. The neocortex displays a relatively
  homogeneous transcriptional pattern, but with distinct features associated
  selectively with primary sensorimotor cortices and with enriched frontal lobe
  expression. Notably, the spatial topography of the neocortex is strongly
  reflected in its molecular topography-the closer two cortical regions, the
  more similar their transcriptomes. This freely accessible online data
  resource forms a high-resolution transcriptional baseline for neurogenetic
  studies of normal and abnormal human brain function.</p></blockquote></li>

A genome-wide association study identifies five loci influencing facial

<blockquote><p>Inter-individual variation in facial shape is one of the most
  noticeable phenotypes in humans, and it is clearly under genetic regulation;
  however, almost nothing is known about the genetic basis of normal human
  facial morphology. We therefore conducted a genome-wide association study for
  facial shape phenotypes in multiple discovery and replication cohorts,
  considering almost ten thousand individuals of European descent from several
  countries. Phenotyping of facial shape features was based on landmark data
  obtained from three-dimensional head magnetic resonance images (MRIs) and
  two-dimensional portrait images. We identified five independent genetic loci
  associated with different facial phenotypes, suggesting the involvement of
  five candidate genes–PRDM16, PAX3, TP63, C5orf50, and COL17A1–in the
  determination of the human face. Three of them have been implicated
  previously in vertebrate craniofacial development and disease, and the
  remaining two genes potentially represent novel players in the molecular
  networks governing facial development. Our finding at PAX3 influencing the
  position of the nasion replicates a recent GWAS of facial features. In
  addition to the reported GWA findings, we established links between common
  DNA variants previously associated with NSCL/P at 2p21, 8q24, 13q31, and
  17q22 and normal facial-shape variations based on a candidate gene approach.
  Overall our study implies that DNA variants in genes essential for
  craniofacial development contribute with relatively small effect size to the
  spectrum of normal variation in human facial morphology. This observation has
  important consequences for future studies aiming to identify more genes
  involved in the human facial morphology, as well as for potential
  applications of DNA prediction of facial shape such as in future forensic
  applications.</p></blockquote></li>

Assessing the risk of central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin by lesion
  mapping.
<cite>Brain</cite>, 135(Pt 8):2536–2545, Aug 2012.
[DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/aws153">10.1093/brain/aws153</a>]

<blockquote><p>Central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin is an extremely
  distressing and often refractory disorder. There are no well-established
  predictors for pain development after thalamic stroke, and the role of
  different thalamic nuclei is unclear. Here, we used structural magnetic
  resonance imaging to identify the thalamic nuclei, specifically implicated in
  the generation of central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin. Lesions of 10
  patients with central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin and 10 control
  patients with thalamic strokes without pain were identified as volumes of
  interest on magnetic resonance imaging data. Non-linear deformations were
  estimated to match each image with a high-resolution template and were
  applied to each volume of interest. By using a digital atlas of the thalamus,
  we elucidated the involvement of different nuclei with respect to each
  lesion. Patient and control volumes of interest were summed separately to
  identify unique areas of involvement. Voxelwise odds ratio maps were
  calculated to localize the anatomical site where lesions put patients at risk
  of developing central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin. In the patients
  with pain, mainly lateral and posterior thalamic nuclei were affected,
  whereas a more anterior-medial lesion pattern was evident in the controls.
  The lesions of 9 of 10 pain patients overlapped at the border of the ventral
  posterior nucleus and the pulvinar, coinciding with the ventrocaudalis portae
  nucleus. The lesions of this area showed an odds ratio of 81 in favour of
  developing thalamic pain. The high odds ratio at the ventral posterior
  nucleus-pulvinar border zone indicates that this area is crucial in the
  pathogenesis of thalamic pain and demonstrates the feasibility of identifying
  patients at risk of developing central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin
  early after thalamic insults. This provides a basis for pre-emptive treatment
  studies.</p></blockquote></li>

<blockquote><p>Cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO(2)),
  cerebral blood flow (CBF), and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) are important
  indices of healthy aging of the brain. Although a frequent topic of study,
  changes of CBF and CMRO(2) during normal aging are still controversial, as
  some authors find decreases of both CBF and CMRO(2) but increased OEF, while
  others find no change, and yet other find divergent changes. In this
  reanalysis of previously published results from positron emission tomography
  of healthy volunteers, we determined CMRO(2) and CBF in 66 healthy volunteers
  aged 21 to 81 years. The magnitudes of CMRO(2) and CBF declined in large
  parts of the cerebral cortex, including association areas, but the primary
  motor and sensory areas were relatively spared. We found significant
  increases of OEF in frontal and parietal cortices, excluding primary motor
  and somatosensory regions, and in the temporal cortex. Because of the inverse
  relation between OEF and capillary oxygen tension, increased OEF can
  compromise oxygen delivery to neurons, with possible perturbation of energy
  turnover. The results establish a possible mechanism of progression from
  healthy to unhealthy brain aging, as the regions most affected by age are the
  areas that are most vulnerable to neurodegeneration.</p></blockquote></li>

Glucose metabolism in small subcortical structures in Parkinson's
  disease.
<cite>Acta Neurol. Scand.</cite>, 125(5):303–310, May 2012.

<blockquote><p>Evidence from experimental animal models of Parkinson's disease
  (PD) suggests a characteristic pattern of metabolic perturbation in discrete,
  very small basal ganglia structures. These structures are generally too small
  to allow valid investigation by conventional positron emission tomography
  (PET) cameras. However, the high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT) PET
  system has a resolution of 2 mm, sufficient for the investigation of
  important structures such as the pallidum and thalamic subnuclei.Using the
  HRRT, we performed [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) scans on 21 patients with
  PD and 11 age-matched controls. We employed three types of normalization:
  white matter, global mean, and data-driven normalization. We performed
  volume-of-interest analyses of small subcortical gray matter structures.
  Voxel-based comparisons were performed to investigate the extent of cortical
  hypometabolism.The most significant level of relative subcortical
  hypermetabolism was detected in the external pallidum (GPe), irrespective of
  normalization strategy. Hypermetabolism was suggested also in the internal
  pallidum, thalamic subnuclei, and the putamen. Widespread cortical
  hypometabolism was seen in a pattern very similar to previously reported
  patterns in patients with PD.The presence and extent of subcortical
  hypermetabolism in PD is dependent on type of normalization. However, the
  present findings suggest that PD, in addition to widespread cortical
  hypometabolism, is probably characterized by true hypermetabolism in the GPe.
  This finding was predicted by the animal 2-deoxyglucose autoradiography
  literature, in which high-magnitude hypermetabolism was also most robustly
  detected in the GPe.</p></blockquote></li>

Correlations between Stroop task performance and white matter lesion
  measures in late-onset major depression.
<cite>Psychiatry Res</cite>, 202(2):142–149, May 2012.
[DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pscychresns.2011.12.009">10.1016/j.pscychresns.2011.12.009</a>]

<blockquote><p>Cerebral white matter lesions (WMLs) are believed to play an
  important role in a subset of patients with late-onset depression by
  affecting the white matter connectivity in circuitries essential for mood and
  cognition. In this study we used diffusion tensor imaging-based (DTI-based)
  tractography to assess white matter fiber tracts affected by deep WMLs
  (DWMLs) in patients with late-onset major depression and age- and
  gender-matched controls. Tractography outcome, illustrated as pathways
  affected by DWMLs, was analyzed for associations with cognitive performance
  on the Stroop Test (ST). The patients (n=17) performed significantly worse on
  the ST than the controls (n=22). Poor performance on the ST correlated with
  higher lesion load. Regression analysis showed a significant correlation
  between poor performance on the ST and tracts affected by DWMLs in multiple
  brain areas in the control group, but very sparse correlation in the patient
  group. Our results suggest that DWMLs play an important role in the cognitive
  performance of controls,whereas their influence in depressed patients is
  overruled by additional, state-dependent factors. Future focus on the
  tract-specific localization of WMLs using DTI tractography may reveal
  important associations between neuroconnectivity and clinical
  measures.</p></blockquote></li>

<blockquote><p>Identifying genetic variants influencing human brain structures
  may reveal new biological mechanisms underlying cognition and
  neuropsychiatric illness. The volume of the hippocampus is a biomarker of
  incipient Alzheimer's disease and is reduced in schizophrenia, major
  depression and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Whereas many brain imaging
  phenotypes are highly heritable, identifying and replicating genetic
  influences has been difficult, as small effects and the high costs of
  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have led to underpowered studies. Here we
  report genome-wide association meta-analyses and replication for mean
  bilateral hippocampal, total brain and intracranial volumes from a large
  multinational consortium. The intergenic variant rs7294919 was associated
  with hippocampal volume (12q24.22; N = 21,151; P = 6.70 Ã 10(-16)) and the
  expression levels of the positional candidate gene TESC in brain tissue.
  Additionally, rs10784502, located within HMGA2, was associated with
  intracranial volume (12q14.3; N = 15,782; P = 1.12 Ã 10(-12)). We also
  identified a suggestive association with total brain volume at rs10494373

Automated analysis of craniofacial morphology using magnetic resonance

<blockquote><p>Quantitative analysis of craniofacial morphology is of interest
  to scholars working in a wide variety of disciplines, such as anthropology,
  developmental biology, and medicine. T1-weighted (anatomical) magnetic
  resonance images (MRI) provide excellent contrast between soft tissues. Given
  its three-dimensional nature, MRI represents an ideal imaging modality for
  the analysis of craniofacial structure in living individuals. Here we
  describe how T1-weighted MR images, acquired to examine brain anatomy, can
  also be used to analyze facial features. Using a sample of typically
  developing adolescents from the Saguenay Youth Study (N = 597; 292 male, 305
  female, ages: 12 to 18 years), we quantified inter-individual variations in
  craniofacial structure in two ways. First, we adapted existing nonlinear
  registration-based morphological techniques to generate iteratively a
  group-wise population average of craniofacial features. The nonlinear
  transformations were used to map the craniofacial structure of each
  individual to the population average. Using voxel-wise measures of expansion
  and contraction, we then examined the effects of sex and age on
  inter-individual variations in facial features. Second, we employed a
  landmark-based approach to quantify variations in face surfaces. This
  approach involves: (a) placing 56 landmarks (forehead, nose, lips, jaw-line,
  cheekbones, and eyes) on a surface representation of the MRI-based group
  average; (b) warping the landmarks to the individual faces using the inverse
  nonlinear transformation estimated for each person; and (3) using a principal
  components analysis (PCA) of the warped landmarks to identify facial features
  (i.e. clusters of landmarks) that vary in our sample in a correlated fashion.
  As with the voxel-wise analysis of the deformation fields, we examined the
  effects of sex and age on the PCA-derived spatial relationships between
  facial features. Both methods demonstrated significant sexual dimorphism in
  craniofacial structure in areas such as the chin, mandible, lips, and
  nose.</p></blockquote></li>

<blockquote><p>Functional brain imaging and neurosurgery in subcortical areas
  often requires visualization of brain nuclei beyond the resolution of current
  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods. We present techniques used to
  create: (1) a lower resolution 3D atlas, based on the Schaltenbrand and
  Wahren print atlas, which was integrated into a stereotactic neurosurgery
  planning and visualization platform (VIPER); and (2) a higher resolution 3D
  atlas derived from a single set of manually segmented histological slices
  containing nuclei of the basal ganglia, thalamus, basal forebrain, and medial
  temporal lobe. Both atlases were integrated to a canonical MRI (Colin27) from
  a young male participant by manually identifying homologous landmarks. The
  lower resolution atlas was then warped to fit the MRI based on the identified
  landmarks. A pseudo-MRI representation of the high-resolution atlas was
  created, and a non-linear transformation was calculated in order to match the
  atlas to the template MRI. The atlas can then be warped to match the anatomy
  of Parkinson's disease surgical candidates by using 3D automated non-linear
  deformation methods. By way of functional validation of the atlas, the
  location of the sensory thalamus was correlated with stereotactic
  intraoperative physiological data. The position of subthalamic electrode
  positions in patients with Parkinson's disease was also evaluated in the
  atlas-integrated MRI space. Finally, probabilistic maps of subthalamic
  stimulation electrodes were developed, in order to allow group analysis of
  the location of contacts associated with the best motor outcomes. We have
  therefore developed, and are continuing to validate, a high-resolution
  computerized MRI-integrated 3D histological atlas, which is useful in
  functional neurosurgery, and for functional and anatomical studies of the
  human basal ganglia, thalamus, and basal forebrain.</p></blockquote></li>

Testosterone-mediated sex differences in the face shape during adolescence:
  subjective impressions and objective features.
<cite>Horm Behav</cite>, 60(5):681–690, Nov 2011.

<blockquote><p>Sex identification of a face is essential for social cognition.
  Still, perceptual cues indicating the sex of a face, and mechanisms
  underlying their development, remain poorly understood. Previously, our group
  described objective age- and sex-related differences in faces of healthy male
  and female adolescents (12-18 years of age), as derived from magnetic
  resonance images (MRIs) of the adolescents' heads. In this study, we
  presented these adolescent faces to 60 female raters to determine which
  facial features most reliably predicted subjective sex identification.
  Identification accuracy correlated highly with specific MRI-derived facial
  features (e.g. broader forehead, chin, jaw, and nose). Facial features that
  most reliably cued male identity were associated with plasma levels of
  testosterone (above and beyond age). Perceptible sex differences in face
  shape are thus associated with specific facial features whose emergence may
  be, in part, driven by testosterone.</p></blockquote></li>

An MRI based average macaque monkey stereotaxic atlas and space

<blockquote><p>In studies of the human brain, a standard stereotaxic space such
  as the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI space) is widely used to provide
  a common reference for the three-dimensional localization of functional
  activation foci and anatomical structures, enabling the comparison of results
  obtained across different studies. Here we present a standard macaque monkey
  brain MRI template that offers a common stereotaxic reference frame to
  localize anatomical and functional information in an organized and reliable
  way for comparison across individual monkeys and studies. We have used MRI
  volumes from a group of 25 normal adult macaque monkeys (18 cynomolgus and 7
  rhesus) to create a common standard macaque monkey brain as well as atlases
  for each of these species separately. In addition, the digital macaque monkey
  volume was subjected to 3D volumetric analysis and comparison of brain
  structures between the individual brains and the average atlas. Furthermore,
  we provide a means of transforming any macaque MRI volume into MNI monkey
  space coordinates in 3D using simple web based tools. Coordinates in MNI
  monkey space can also be transformed into the coordinate system of a detailed
  neuroanatomical paper atlas (Paxinos et al., 2008), enabling researchers to
  identify and delineate cortical and subcortical structures in their
  individual macaque monkey brains.</p></blockquote></li>

<blockquote><p>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective
  therapies for depression and has beneficial motor effects in parkinsonian
  patients. However, little is known about the mechanisms of therapeutic action
  of ECT for either condition. The aim of this work was to explore the impact
  of ECT on dopaminergic function in the striatum of non-human primates. Rhesus
  monkeys underwent a course of six ECT treatments under a human clinical
  protocol. Longitudinal effects on the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system were
  studied over 6 weeks using the in vivo capabilities of positron emission
  tomography (PET). PET scans were performed prior to the onset of ECT
  treatments and at 24-48 h, 8-10 days, and 6 weeks after the final ECT
  treatment. Early increases in dopamine transporter and vesicular monoamine
  transporter 2 binding returned to baseline levels by 6 weeks post-ECT.
  Transient increases in D1 receptor binding were also observed, whereas the
  binding potential to D2 receptors was unaltered. The increase in dopaminergic
  neurotransmission suggested by our results may account in part for the
  therapeutic effect of ECT in mood disorders and Parkinson's
  disease.</p></blockquote></li>

Defining the intercommissural plane and stereotactic coordinates for the

<blockquote><p>The intercommissural line joining the anterior and posterior
  commissures defines stereotactic coordinate systems used in functional
  neurosurgical procedures. Such coordinate systems are generally accepted in
  humans and nonhuman primate experimental settings and provide high
  stereotactic precision and reproducibility. The ethical concern surrounding
  the use of nonhuman primates has motivated and helped popularize the use of
  the GÃ¶ttingen minipig as an alternative experimental model for
  experimental functional neurosurgery. We investigated the position and
  variability of the intercommissural line in the minipig brain using in vivo
  MRI. From these data, standard coordinates for the minipig basal ganglia were
  estimated. We found the variability of the intercommissural line to be small
  in the GÃ¶ttingen minipig and the variability of the basal ganglia
  structures to the mid-commissural point to be minor.</p></blockquote></li>

Depression severity is correlated to the integrity of white matter fiber

<blockquote><p>Cerebral white matter lesions (WMLs) are believed to play an
  important role in a subset of major depression (MD). We aimed to describe the
  impact of WMLs on white matter pathways in MD using diffusion tensor imaging
  (DTI) and magnetization transfer imaging. As a novel approach, we used DTI
  tractography to assess pathways intersected by WMLs. We examined 22 patients
  with late-onset MD and 22 age- and gender-matched controls. Parametric maps
  of fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and
  magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) were obtained to describe tissue
  integrity. The association between depression severity and the tract-specific
  localization of WMLs was analyzed on a voxel-by-voxel basis. We showed a
  significant positive association between depression severity and fiber tracts
  intersected by WMLs in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus and the
  right uncinate fasciculus. In both groups, WMLs had significantly lower FA
  and MTR, and higher ADC than both the tracts they intersected and the
  normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). In turn, the tracts intersected by WMLs
  had significantly lower FA and higher ADC than the NAWM. In conclusion,
  depression severity correlates with the tract-specific localization of WMLs.
  WMLs have a pronounced effect on white matter integrity in the pathways they
  intersect.</p></blockquote></li>

<blockquote><p>The basal ganglia and thalamus together connect in parallel
  closed-loop circuits with the cortex. Previous imaging studies have shown
  modifications of the basal ganglia and cortical targets in individuals with
  Tourette syndrome (TS), but less is known regarding the role of the thalamus
  in TS pathogenesis.To study the morphological features of the thalamus in
  children and adults with TS.A cross-sectional, case-control study using
  anatomical magnetic resonance imaging.University research center.The
  283 participants included 149 with TS and 134 normal control individuals aged
  6 to 63 years.Conventional volumes and measures of surface morphology of
  the thalamus.Analyses of conventional volumes and surface morphology were
  consistent in demonstrating an enlargement in TS-affected thalami. Overall
  volumes were 5% larger in the group composed of children and adults with TS.
  Statistical maps of surface contour demonstrated enlargement over the lateral
  thalamus. Post hoc testing indicated that differences in IQ, comorbid
  illnesses, and medication use did not account for these findings.
  Morphological abnormalities in the thalamus, together with the disturbances
  reported in the sensorimotor cortex, striatum, and globus pallidus, support
  the hypothesis of a circuitwide disorder within motor pathways in TS. The
  connectivity and function of the numerous and diverse thalamic nuclei within
  cortical-subcortical circuits constitute an anatomical crossroad wherein
  enlargement of motor nuclei may represent activity-dependent hypertrophy
  within this component of cortical-subcortical motor circuits, or an adaptive
  response within a larger putative compensatory system that could thereby
  directly modulate activity in motor circuits to attenuate the severity of
  tics.</p></blockquote></li>

Cortical hypometabolism and hypoperfusion in Parkinson's disease is
  extensive: probably even at early disease stages.
<cite>Brain Struct Funct</cite>, 214(4):303–317, May 2010.
[DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00429-010-0246-0">10.1007/s00429-010-0246-0</a>]

<blockquote><p>Recent cerebral blood flow (CBF) and glucose consumption
  (CMRglc) studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) revealed conflicting results.
  Using simulated data, we previously demonstrated that the often-reported
  subcortical hypermetabolism in PD could be explained as an artifact of biased
  global mean (GM) normalization, and that low-magnitude, extensive cortical
  hypometabolism is best detected by alternative data-driven normalization
  methods. Thus, we hypothesized that PD is characterized by extensive cortical
  hypometabolism but no concurrent widespread subcortical hypermetabolism and
  tested it on three independent samples of PD patients. We compared SPECT CBF
  images of 32 early-stage and 33 late-stage PD patients with that of 60
  matched controls. We also compared PET FDG images from 23 late-stage PD
  patients with that of 13 controls. Three different normalization methods were
  compared: (1) GM normalization, (2) cerebellum normalization, (3) reference
  cluster normalization (Yakushev et al.). We employed standard voxel-based
  statistics (fMRIstat) and principal component analysis (SSM). Additionally,
  we performed a meta-analysis of all quantitative CBF and CMRglc studies in
  the literature to investigate whether the global mean (GM) values in PD are
  decreased. Voxel-based analysis with GM normalization and the SSM method
  performed similarly, i.e., both detected decreases in small cortical clusters
  and concomitant increases in extensive subcortical regions. Cerebellum
  normalization revealed more widespread cortical decreases but no subcortical
  increase. In all comparisons, the Yakushev method detected nearly identical
  patterns of very extensive cortical hypometabolism. Lastly, the meta-analyses
  demonstrated that global CBF and CMRglc values are decreased in PD. Based on
  the results, we conclude that PD most likely has widespread cortical
  hypometabolism, even at early disease stages. In contrast, extensive
  subcortical hypermetabolism is probably not a feature of
  PD.</p></blockquote></li>

Morphological abnormalities of the thalamus in youths with attention deficit

<cite>Am J Psychiatry</cite>, 167(4):397–408, Apr 2010.

<blockquote><p>The role of the thalamus in the genesis of attention deficit
  hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remains poorly understood. The authors used
  anatomical MRI to examine the morphology of the thalamus in youths with ADHD
  and healthy comparison youths.The authors examined 46 youths with ADHD and
  59 comparison youths 8-18 years of age in a cross-sectional case-control
  study. Conventional volumes and measures of surface morphology of the
  thalamus served as the main outcome measures.A mixed-effects model
  comparing whole thalamic volumes revealed no significant differences between
  groups. Maps of the thalamic surface revealed significantly smaller regional
  volumes bilaterally in the pulvinar in youths with ADHD relative to
  comparison subjects. Post hoc analyses showed that ADHD patients who received
  stimulants (N=31) had larger conventional thalamic volumes than untreated
  youths with ADHD, and maps of the thalamic surface showed enlargement over
  the pulvinar in those receiving stimulants. Smaller regional volumes in the
  right lateral and left posterior thalamic surfaces were associated with more
  severe hyperactivity symptoms, whereas larger regional volumes in the right
  medial thalamic surfaces were associated with more severe symptoms of
  inattention.These findings demonstrate reduced pulvinar volumes in youths
  with ADHD and indicate that this same area is relatively enlarged in patients
  treated with stimulants compared to those untreated. Associations of
  hyperactivity scores with smaller regional volumes on the lateral thalamic
  surface and inattention scores with larger regional volumes on the medial
  thalamic surface suggest the differential involvement of thalamic subcircuits
  in the pathogenesis of differing ADHD symptoms.</p></blockquote></li>

Blindsight mediated by an S-cone-independent collicular pathway: an
  fMRI study in hemispherectomized subjects.
<cite>J Cogn Neurosci</cite>, 22(4):670–682, Apr 2010.
[DOI:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/jocn.2009.21217">10.1162/jocn.2009.21217</a>]

<blockquote><p>The purpose of our study was to investigate the ability to
  process achromatic and short-wavelength-sensitive cone (S-cone)-isolating
  (blue-yellow) stimuli in the blind visual field of hemispherectomized
  subjects and to demonstrate that blindsight is mediated by a collicular
  pathway that is independent of S-cone inputs. Blindsight has been described
  as the ability to respond to visual stimuli in the blind visual field without
  conscious awareness [Weiskrantz, L., Warrington, E. K., Sanders, M. D., &amp;
  Marshall, J. Visual capacity in the hemianopic field following a restricted
  occipital ablation. Brain, 97, 709-728, 1974]. The roles of the subcortical
  neural structures in blindsight, such as the pulvinar and the superior
  colliculus, have been debated and an underlying neural correlate has yet to
  be confirmed. Using fMRI, we tested the ability to process visual stimuli
  that isolated the achromatic and short-wavelength-sensitive (S-)-cone
  pathways in three subjects: one control subject, one hemispherectomized
  subject with blindsight, and one hemispherectomized subject without
  blindsight. We demonstrated that (1) achromatic and S-cone-isolating stimuli
  presented to the normal visual hemifield of hemispherectomized subjects and
  to both visual hemifields of the control subject activated contralateral
  visual areas (V1/V2), as expected; (2) achromatic stimulus presentation but
  not S-cone-isolating stimulus presentation to the blind hemifield of the
  subject with blindsight activated visual areas FEF/V5; (3) whereas the
  cortical activation of the control subject was enhanced by an additional
  stimulus (achromatic and S-cone isolating) presented in the contralateral
  visual field, activation pattern of the subject with blindsight was enhanced
  by achromatic stimuli only. We conclude that the human superior colliculus is
  blind to the S-cone-isolating stimuli, and blindsight is mediated by an
  S-cone-independent collicular pathway.</p></blockquote></li>

Areal and laminar differentiation in the mouse neocortex using large scale

<blockquote><p>Although cytoarchitectonic organization of the mammalian cortex
  into different lamina has been well-studied, identifying the architectural
  differences that distinguish cortical areas from one another is more
  challenging. Localization of large anatomical structures is possible using
  magnetic resonance imaging or invasive techniques (such as anterograde or
  retrograde tracing), but identifying patterns in gene expression architecture
  is limited as gene products do not necessarily identify an immediate
  functional consequence of a specialized area. Expression of specific genes in
  the mouse and human cortex is most often identified across entire lamina, and
  areal patterning of expression (when it exists) is most easily differentiated
  on a layer-by-layer basis. Since cortical organization is defined by the
  expression of large sets of genes, the task of identifying individual (or
  groups of structures) cannot be done using individual areal markers. In this
  manuscript we describe a methodology for clustering gene expression
  correlation profiles in the C57Bl/6J mouse cortex to identify large-scale
  genetic relationships between layers and areas. By using the Anatomic Gene
  Expression Atlas (http://mouse.brain-map.org/agea/) derived from in situ
  hybridization data in the Allen Brain Atlas, we show that a consistent
  expression based organization of areal patterning in the mouse cortex exists
  when clustered on a laminar basis. Surface-based mapping and visualization
  techniques are used as a representation to clarify these
  relationships.</p></blockquote></li>

<blockquote><p>Due to its unique sensitivity to tissue microstructure,
  diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has found many
  applications in clinical and fundamental science. With few exceptions, a more
  precise correspondence between physiological or biophysical properties and
  the obtained diffusion parameters remain uncertain due to lack of
  specificity. In this work, we address this problem by comparing diffusion
  parameters of a recently introduced model for water diffusion in brain matter
  to light microscopy and quantitative electron microscopy. Specifically, we
  compare diffusion model predictions of neurite density in rats to optical
  myelin staining intensity and stereological estimation of neurite volume
  fraction using electron microscopy. We find that the diffusion model
  describes data better and that its parameters show stronger correlation with
  optical and electron microscopy, and thus reflect myelinated neurite density
  better than the more frequently used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and
  cumulant expansion methods. Furthermore, the estimated neurite orientations
  capture dendritic architecture more faithfully than DTI diffusion
  ellipsoids.</p></blockquote></li>

<blockquote><p>Advanced and exclusive software solutions are offered to reduce
  susceptibility artefacts on MRI echo-planar sequences. We present a
  straightforward surgical technique to reduce the cortical distortion and
  signal loss that normally occur using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the
  GÃ¶ttingen minipig brain. Pronounced pneumatisation of the minipig cranium
  causes considerable susceptibility artefacts at the air/tissue interface
  around the frontal sinuses. Five GÃ¶ttingen minipigs had burr holes drilled
  through the outer lamina of the skull bilaterally at the level of bregma. The
  underlying frontal sinuses were filled with a suspension of an MRI-compatible
  alginate. DTI was obtained before and after placing the medium in the sinus,
  quantifying the change using mutual information and Wilcoxon's rank-sum test.
  Fibertracking algorithms were applied to visualize the effect of treatment.
  We showed that the susceptibility artefacts were reduced at the air, bone and
  brain interfaces and that major cortical fiberbundles could be reliably
  visualized. This study demonstrated that DTI fibertracking of cortical
  bundles in experimental animals with extensive skull pneumatisation is
  feasible even when advanced software is unavailable.</p></blockquote></li>

Comparison of piece-wise linear, linear, and nonlinear atlas-to-patient

<blockquote><p>Digital atlases are commonly used in pre-operative planning in
  functional neurosurgical procedures performed to minimize the symptoms of
  Parkinson's disease. These atlases can be customized to fit an individual
  patient's anatomy through atlas-to-patient warping procedures. Once fitted to
  pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, the customized atlas can
  be used to plan and navigate surgical procedures. Linear, piece-wise linear
  and nonlinear registration methods have been used to customize different
  digital atlases with varying accuracies. Our goal was to evaluate eight
  different registration methods for atlas-to-patient customization of a new
  digital atlas of the basal ganglia and thalamus to demonstrate the value of
  nonlinear registration for automated atlas-based subcortical target
  identification in functional neurosurgery. In this work, we evaluate the
  accuracy of two automated linear techniques, two piece-wise linear techniques
  (requiring the identification of manually placed anatomical landmarks), and
  four different automated nonlinear atlas-to-patient warping techniques (where
  two of the four nonlinear techniques are variants of the ANIMAL algorithm).
  Since a gold standard of the subcortical anatomy is not available, manual
  segmentations of the striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus are used to
  derive a silver standard for evaluation. Four different metrics, including
  the kappa statistic, the mean distance between the surfaces, the maximum
  distance between surfaces, and the total structure volume are used to compare
  the warping techniques. The results show that nonlinear techniques perform
  statistically better than linear and piece-wise linear techniques. In
  addition, the results demonstrate statistically significant differences
  between the nonlinear techniques, with the ANIMAL algorithm yielding better
  results.</p></blockquote></li>

Design, construction, and validation of an MRI-compatible vibrotactile

<blockquote><p>Vibrotactile stimulation has been used successfully to activate
  the human somatosensory pathway in functional magnetic resonance imaging
  (fMRI) experiments. The design and characterization of these devices are of
  particular interest in frequency discrimination tasks and investigations of
  the somatopic organization of sensory areas. However, few have investigated
  the utility of vibrotactile stimulation in a clinical context. We have
  previously demonstrated that vibrotactile stimulation can provide robust
  activations in areas targeted in stereotactic functional neurosurgical
  procedures used for tumour resection (i.e.: primary and secondary
  somatosensory areas) and subcortical targets for thalamic pain and movement
  disorders (i.e.: sensory thalamus). The main contribution of this manuscript
  is the presentation of the design, materials, construction, and validation of
  a novel vibrotactile stimulator intended for clinical use. The thalamic
  activations are also compared to a digital atlas in order to evaluate
  anatomical localization. The proposed stimulator was constructed entirely
  from non-ferromagnetic parts, uses compressed air to deliver stimulation
  using computer control, and stimulates the entirety of the hand and fingers
  to ensure robust somatosensory activations. In addition, this stimulator is
  constructed entirely from "off-the-shelf" parts and would be easily
  replicated due to the simplicity of design and the relatively small expense
  of the parts required. The device was tested by stimulating the right hand of
  10 normal controls (5 females, 5 males, all right handed; age range: 25-42
  years, mean: 30.9 years, standard deviation: 5.2 years) during an fMRI
  experiment. The results demonstrate significant single subject activations of
  primary and secondary somatosensory cortices and of the sensory
  thalamus.</p></blockquote></li>

Robust S1, S2, and thalamic activations in individual subjects with

<blockquote><p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is often used to
  enhance visualization and provide target localization during the planning
  phase of neurosurgical procedures. Although parametric maps have been used to
  identify areas of eloquent cortex such as the primary (S1) and secondary (S2)
  somatosensory areas for tumor surgery, to date, few fMRI methods exist to
  localize subcortical targets for surgical interventions used to treat
  movement disorders. The scanning time required to obtain statistically
  significant functional signals must be balanced against the possibility of
  movement artifacts and patient discomfort. We propose a vibrotactile
  stimulation technique to activate the somatosensory pathway for neurosurgical
  planning and perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the amount of time
  required to achieve significant activations of S1, S2, and sensory thalamus
  in individual subjects. Bilateral stimulation experiments were carried out on
  two MRI scanners (n = 13 at 1.5 T; n = 5 at 3.0 T). The analysis demonstrates
  that statistically significant functional activations can be achieved in
  clinically acceptable times: 16 min at 1.5 T (26/26 experiments) and 6 min at
  3.0 T (10/10) for S1 activations; 24 min at 1.5 T (22/26) and 18 min at 3.0 T
  for S2 activations (9/10); and 32 min at 1.5 T (15/26) and 18 min at 3.0 T
  (10/10) for activation of thalamic nuclei. These results demonstrate that S1
  and S2 activations are robust at 1.5 and 3.0 T, and that robust thalamic
  activations in individual subjects are possible at 3.0 T. These techniques
  demonstrate that this technique can be used for preoperative planning for
  surgical candidates.</p></blockquote></li>

The connectivity of the human pulvinar: a diffusion tensor imaging

<blockquote><p>Previous studies in nonhuman primates and cats have shown that
  the pulvinar receives input from various cortical and subcortical areas
  involved in vision. Although the contribution of the pulvinar to human vision
  remains to be established, anatomical tracer and electrophysiological animal
  studies on cortico-pulvinar circuits suggest an important role of this
  structure in visual spatial attention, visual integration, and higher-order
  visual processing. Because methodological constraints limit investigations of
  the human pulvinar's function, its role could, up to now, only be inferred
  from animal studies. In the present study, we used an innovative imaging
  technique, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) tractography, to determine cortical
  and subcortical connections of the human pulvinar. We were able to
  reconstruct pulvinar fiber tracts and compare variability across subjects in
  vivo. Here we demonstrate that the human pulvinar is interconnected with
  subcortical structures (superior colliculus, thalamus, and caudate nucleus)
  as well as with cortical regions (primary visual areas (area 17), secondary
  visual areas (area 18, 19), visual inferotemporal areas (area 20), posterior
  parietal association areas (area 7), frontal eye fields and prefrontal
  areas). These results are consistent with the connectivity reported in animal
  anatomical studies.</p></blockquote></li>

Towards a validation of atlas warping techniques.

<blockquote><p>Pre-operative magnetic resonance (MRI) and computed tomography
  (CT) image volumes are often used for planning and guidance during functional
  neurosurgical procedures. These operations can include the creation of
  lesions in the thalamus (thalamotomy) or the globus pallidus (pallidotomy),
  or the insertion of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes in the
  subcortical nuclei. These subcortical targets are often difficult to localize
  in pre-operative imaging data due to the limited resolution and contrast
  available in standard MRI or CT techniques. To address this problem, digital
  atlases of subcortical nuclei are often used to accurately identify surgical
  targets since they can be warped to fit each patient's unique anatomy.
  Targeting accuracy thus depends on the quality of the atlas-to-patient warp.
  In this paper, three atlas-to-patient warping techniques are compared. Two
  methods rely on an MRI template as an intermediary to estimate a nonlinear
  atlas-to-patient transformation. The third is novel, and uses a pseudo-MRI
  derived from an atlas of the basal ganglia and thalamus to estimate the
  nonlinear atlas-to-patient transformation directly. The methods are compared
  using (1) manual segmentations of subcortical nuclei and (2) functional data
  from intra-operative thalamic stimulation. The results demonstrate that the
  template-based atlas-to-patient warping technique is the best of the three
  for customizing the atlas onto patient data.</p></blockquote></li>

<blockquote><p>Quantitative analysis of digitized IHC-stained tissue sections
  is increasingly used in research studies and clinical practice. Accurate
  quantification of IHC staining, however, is often complicated by conventional
  tissue counterstains caused by the color convolution of the IHC chromogen and
  the counterstain. To overcome this issue, we implemented a new counterstain,
  Acid Blue 129, which provides homogeneous tissue background staining.
  Furthermore, we combined this counterstaining technique with a simple,
  robust, fully automated image segmentation algorithm, which takes advantage
  of the high degree of color separation between the 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbazole
  (AEC) chromogen and the Acid Blue 129 counterstain. Rigorous validation of
  the automated technique against manual segmentation data, using Ki-67 IHC
  sections from rat C6 glioma and beta-amyloid IHC sections from transgenic
  mice with amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutations, has shown the automated
  method to produce highly accurate results compared with ground truth
  estimates based on the manually segmented images. The synergistic combination
  of the novel tissue counterstaining and image segmentation techniques
  described in this study will allow for accurate, reproducible, and efficient
  quantitative IHC studies for a wide range of antibodies and
  tissues.</p></blockquote></li>

Fronto-striatal connections in the human brain: a probabilistic diffusion

<blockquote><p>Anatomical studies in animals have described multiple striatal
  circuits and suggested that sub-components of the striatum, although
  functionally related, project to distinct cortical areas. To date, anatomical
  investigations in humans have been limited by methodological constraints such
  that most of our knowledge of fronto-striatal networks relies on nonhuman
  primate studies. To better identify the fronto-striatal pathways in the human
  brain, we used Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) tractography to reconstruct
  neural connections between the frontal cortex and the caudate nucleus and
  putamen in vivo. We demonstrate that the human caudate nucleus is
  interconnected with the prefrontal cortex, inferior and middle temporal
  gyrus, frontal eye fields, cerebellum and thalamus; the putamen is
  interconnected with the prefrontal cortex, primary motor area, primary
  somatosensory cortex, supplementary motor area, premotor area, cerebellum and
  thalamus. A connectivity-based seed classification analysis identified
  connections between the dorsolateral prefrontal areas (DLPFC) and the
  dorsal-posterior caudate nucleus and between the ventrolateral prefrontal
  areas (VLPFC) and the ventral-anterior caudate nucleus. For the putamen,
  connections exist between the supplementary motor area (SMA) and
  dorsal-posterior putamen while the premotor area projects to medial putamen,
  and the primary motor area to the lateral putamen. Identifying the anatomical
  organization of the fronto-striatal network has important implications for
  understanding basal ganglia function and associated disease
  processes.</p></blockquote></li>

Towards a multi-modal atlas for neurosurgical planning.

<blockquote><p>Digital brain atlases can be used in conjuction with magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) for planning and
  guidance during neurosurgery. Digital atlases are advantageous since they can
  be warped nonlinearly to fit each patient's unique anatomy. Functional
  neurosurgery with implantation of deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrodes
  requires accurate targeting, and has become a popular surgical technique in
  Parkinsonian patients. In this paper, we present a method for integrating
  postoperative data from subthalamic (STN) DBS implantation into an antomical
  atlas of the basal ganglia and thalamus. The method estimates electrode
  position from post-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. These
  electrodes are then warped back into the atlas space and are modelled in
  three dimensions. The average of these models is then taken to show the
  region where the majority of STN DBS electrodes were implanted. The group
  with more favorable post-operative results was separated from the group which
  responded to the STN DBS implantation procedure less favourably to create a
  probablisitic distribution of DBS in the STN
  electrodes.</p></blockquote></li>

The creation of a brain atlas for image guided neurosurgery using serial

<blockquote><p>Digital and print brain atlases have been used with success to
  help in the planning of neurosurgical interventions. In this paper, a
  technique presented for the creation of a brain atlas of the basal ganglia
  and the thalamus derived from serial histological data. Photographs of
  coronal histological sections were digitized and anatomical structures were
  manually segmented. A slice-to-slice nonlinear registration technique was
  used to correct for spatial distortions introduced into the histological data
  set at the time of acquisition. Since the histological data were acquired
  without any anatomical reference (e.g., block-face imaging, post-mortem MRI),
  this registration technique was optimized to use an error metric which
  calculates a nonlinear transformation minimizing the mean distance between
  the segmented contours between adjacent pairs of slices in the data set. A
  voxel-by-voxel intensity correction field was also estimated for each slice
  to correct for lighting and staining inhomogeneity. The reconstructed
  three-dimensional (3D) histological volume can be viewed in transverse and
  sagittal directions in addition to the original coronal. Nonlinear
  transformations used to correct for spatial distortions of the histological
  data were applied to the segmented structure contours. These contours were
  then tessellated to create three-dimensional geometric objects representing
  the different anatomic regions in register with the histological volumes.
  This yields two alternate representations (one histological and one
  geometric) of the atlas. To register the atlas to a standard reference MR
  volume created from the average of 27 T1-weighted MR volumes, a pseudo-MRI
  was created by setting the intensity of each anatomical region defined in the
  geometric atlas to match the intensity of the corresponding region of the
  reference MR volume. This allowed the estimation of a 3D nonlinear
  transformation using a correlation based registration scheme to fit the atlas
  to the reference MRI. The result of this procedure is a contiguous 3D
  histological volume, a set of 3D objects defining the basal ganglia and
  thalamus, both of which are registered to a standard MRI data set, for use
  for neurosurgical planning.</p></blockquote></li>
