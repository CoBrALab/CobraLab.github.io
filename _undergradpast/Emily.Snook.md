I joined the CoBrA Lab in September 2017 and am currently working on my undergraduate Honours Neuroscience research project. The project involves phenotyping influence of maternal immune activation on postnatal rodent offspring using structural MRI. Outside the lab, I enjoy salsa dancing, playing guitar, and seeking out free food.
