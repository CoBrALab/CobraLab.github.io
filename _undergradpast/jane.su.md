Jane joined the CoBrA Lab in winter 2015 as a Research Assistant. She is interested in using high resolution rat brain MRI scans to produce an atlas of an average rat. This project combines her knowledge of computer science and neuroanatomy. This rat atlas will be made available to the public and can be used in future neuroscience research. Jane is currently an undergraduate at McGill University studying neuroscience.
