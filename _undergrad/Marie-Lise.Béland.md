Marie-Lise is an undergraduate student in Neuroscience at McGill who joined the CoBrA lab in May 2018. She is currently working on one of the human studies conducted by our lab, “High-resolution MRI-based biomarkers for identifying risk for Alzheimer’s disease”. She created a database for this study and is currently working on data entry.

Last year, Marie-Lise was involved in a human study currently being conducted by our lab which looks at individuals at high risk for psychosis. She created the database for this project as well and helped with testing participants.

Marie-Lise was also involved in recruiting and testing participants for a study assessing the impact of upgrading from a Siemens 3T Trio system to a 3T PRISMA system and for a study of the “effects of normal and healthy aging on hippocampal subfield anatomy”.

This summer, she will begin a project focusing on the association between cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and hippocampal subfield volumes in Alzheimer’s patients.

In her free time, Marie-Lise enjoys going to the gym, hiking, skiing and binge-watching Netflix series.
