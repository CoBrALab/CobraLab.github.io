Stephanie is currently an undergraduate student at McGill University pursuing a degree in Neuroscience. She is interested in the influence of various factors such as environmental influences or genetic factors on brain structure and behaviour. Moreover, she is interested in neurodegenerative disorders and their cytopathology, and studying its effects on brain anatomy through neuroimaging techniques.

Stephanie joined the CoBrA lab in May 2015. She is currently working on the Healthy Aging project in which is studying the effects of normal and healthy aging on hippocampal subfield anatomy. She is also working on an atlas of the basal ganglia and thalamus, as well as other subcortical structures, to explore the effects of healthy aging on these structures, and to study the implications of these structures in Parkinson's disease and other mental illnesses.
