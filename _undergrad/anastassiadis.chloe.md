Chloe Anastassiadis studies Cognitive Science in the Bachelor of Arts and Science at McGill. She joined the CoBra Lab in July 2015 as a research assistant, and is currently working with Vivian Lynn and Robert Amaral on a project involving the manual segmentation of the hippocampus on MRIs scans. Eventually, this work will allow them to determine the precision of the algorithm MAGeT, by comparing automatically generated atlases of the brain with manually segmented ones.

She hopes to get to work with MAGeT later in her academic course, because such algorithm -if proved to be efficient- would greatly facilitate comparisons in shape and volume between the anatomical brain structures of different populations. There would thus be an almost unlimited potential for the generation of new research questions in neuroscience and psychiatry.
