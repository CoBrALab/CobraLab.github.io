Nadia is currently an undergraduate student in Cognitive Science at McGill University. 
She joined the lab in September 2018 to study the heritability of subcortical structures 
(extension of Dr. Sejal Patelâ€™s work on the heritability of the hippocampus). When she 
is not quality controlling structural images for segmentation accuracy, she can be found 
camouflaged under a pile of comic books.
