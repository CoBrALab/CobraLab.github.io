Olivier is an undergrad student in Psychology at the University of Montreal.

He joined the lab in August 2020 as part of a laboratory class.

He is particularly interested in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. 

His work focuses on the relations between white matter hyperintensities (imaging markers of vascular damage in the brain), 
cognition and anatomical features such as cortical thickness. He previously worked on examining the validity of the diagnostic 
criteria of idiopathic hypersomnia, and also on the spatio-temporal integration of inputs by a single neuron.

In his free time he loves to cook and go on hikes.
