Colleen joined the CoBrA Lab as a Research Assistant in May 2015. Currently pursuing her B.Sc. in Neuroscience at McGill University, Colleen is interested in the behavioural and neuroanatomical correlates of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. She is currently exploring the contribution of different modifiable risk factors (ie. diabetes, smoking, obesity, depression) to Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). Specifically, she is conducting a project investigating the impact of mid-life obesity on AD pathology in a mouse model of AD.
