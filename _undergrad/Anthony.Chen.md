Hi! My name is Anthony and I am currently an undergraduate student at McGill University with interests in both neuroscience and the computer sciences. I joined the CoBrA lab in May 2017.

I am interested in using computational techniques to investigate the brain. Presently, I am optimizing an in-vivo microstructural parcellation technique, which is a data-driven method that subdivides a given subcortical structure into parcels (similar clusters of voxels) based on multivariate MRI data.

Outside of the lab, you can find me in my natural sloth habitat.  I also enjoy good books, coffee, mostly old music and Montreal bagels.
