I am an undergraduate student entering my third year in the Physiology and Physics program at McGill. I joined the CoBrA lab in summer 2018 to help Chloe Anastassiadis with her project about rescuing the effects of obesity on Alzheimer's through diet and exercise. I will be performing histological analyses on mouse brains to quantify the spread of amyloid-beta and tau.
