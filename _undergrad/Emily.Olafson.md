I'm an undergraduate student in Neuroscience at McGill and I joined the CoBrA lab in May 2018. I'm helping Saashi run the MAGeT segmentation algorithm on a large autism MRI dataset to analyze subcortical structure morphology. Outside the lab, you can find me biking, gardening, and drinking coffee (all at once).
