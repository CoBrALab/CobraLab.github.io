David joined the CoBrA lab in 2019 as a Master's student in McGill's Integrated Program in Neuroscience. 
He is a Montessori elementary school teacher with a decade of classroom experience in Canada and the United States. 
His interest in neuroscience is rooted in his work with children and a desire to better understand both typical and 
atypical neurodevelopment. In the CoBrA lab, Dave is examining differences in subcortical morphology in autism spectrum 
disorders, using a large, multi-site dataset to identify factors that contribute to heterogeneity.

David holds a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience and Mental Health from Carleton University and a Bachelor of Arts 
in German Studies from Dalhousie University / The University of King's College. At Carleton, he studied the effects 
of chronic stress on hypothalamic energy homeostasis circuits. 

In his spare time, Dave enjoys being in a canoe, growing food, making things out of wood, and reading good books.
