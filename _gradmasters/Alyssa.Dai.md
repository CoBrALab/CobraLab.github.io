Alyssa joined the lab in May 2020 after completing a Bachelor's in Neuroscience at McGill, 
and is currently a Master’s student in McGill’s IPN. During her Bachelor’s, she studied the 
effects of Christianson Syndrome-associated variants of NHE6 (an alkali cation/proton exchanger) 
on cellular trafficking in neural cells.

In the CoBrA Lab, Alyssa is using MRI data to investigate changes in the structure-function 
coupling of brain networks from healthy through high-risk states for psychosis, to the onset 
of frank psychosis and schizophrenia. She is also studying how the relationship between 
structural and functional connectivity links to psychosis symptoms and other dimensions of psychopathology.


Outside the lab, Alyssa can be found baking, rewatching sitcoms, or curled up with a good book.
