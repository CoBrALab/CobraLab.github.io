Mila joined the lab in May 2018, while she was pursuing her undergraduate degree in Physiology and Physics at McGill. In her first year at the lab, she assisted with Chloe Anastassiadis's Masters project
on rescuing the effects of obesity on Alzheimerâ€™s disease progression through exercise and diet.
As part of this project, she analyzed mouse Morris Water Maze mouse behavioral data using Principal Components Analysis.
 
Mila stayed at the lab to complete her undergraduate honour's thesis. Her project focused on developing a technique for performing myelin imaging in mice via magnetization transfer on a surface cryogenic coil.
 
Now, as a masters student in Biomedical Engineering at McGill, her project will incorporate both myelin imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how the developmental timing of hypomyelination impacts the formation of functional networks. 

In her free time, she likes playing clarinet or reading.
