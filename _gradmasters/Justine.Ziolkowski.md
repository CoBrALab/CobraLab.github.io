Justine joined the CoBrA Lab in 2020 after completing a Bachelor of Science degree in
Psychology at the University of Toronto. Her undergraduate thesis characterized the
role of neuroendocrine mechanisms involved in shaping the complex social structure of
naked mole-rats. After graduating, Justine worked with neurodiverse children in clinical
and research settings, many of whom inspired her academic interests.

Justine is pursuing a Master’s degree in McGill’s Integrated Program in Neuroscience.
Her research efforts are focused on understanding the neural correlates of phenotypic
variability in autism spectrum disorder. To this end, she is investigating features of
cortical morphometry in autistic individuals by integrating various structural imaging
modalities.

Off the clock, Justine enjoys kickboxing, playing board games, and exploring new hiking
trails.
