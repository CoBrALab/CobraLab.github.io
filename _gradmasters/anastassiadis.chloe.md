Chloe Anastassiadis is a Master's student in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience at McGill University. She started working at the CoBrA Lab as an undergraduate student, and became involved in the creation of a manual segmentation protocol for the medial temporal lobe cortices (perirhinal, parahippocampal, and entorhinal) and the subicular formation (presubiculum and parasubiculum) using structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. She also works with Sherri Lee Jones from the Pruessner and King laboratories to develop a parcellation protocol of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland.

For her Master's she picked a project that combined her interest in neuroanatomy and structural MRI with a completely different set of skills, as she is now collecting imaging, behavioural, and histological data from a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, Chloe's current project aims to assess the efficiency of exercise and/or change of diet in rescuing the nefarious effects of diet-induced adult obesity on memory function and brain development.
