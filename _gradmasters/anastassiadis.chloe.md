Chloe is a Master's student in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience at McGill. She joined the lab in 2015 as an undergraduate student in Cognitive Science to help Robert Amaral in his segmentation project on the medial temporal lobe cortices. Building on that knowledge, she then created for her thesis project, with Dr. Jens Pruessner and Dr. Sherri Lee Jones, a manual segmentation protocol of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The protocol was validated from longitudinal MRI data collected by Dr. Suzanne King from children exposed to prenatal maternal stress. In order to expand her research scope and technical skillset, she then participated in Elisa Guma's study aiming to characterize a mouse model of neurodevelopmental disorders using MRI and behavioural tests.

Chloe wanted to continue working with mouse models. In her Master's project she examines the effects of dietary and exercise-based interventions in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. More specifically, she assesses first the impact of a high-fat diet on longitudinal anatomical changes and on memory function in transgenic mice and their wild-type counterparts. She then compares three rescue interventions, which incorporate a return to a normal diet and/or more exercise.

When she is not traveling or giving travel recommendations, Chloe very much enjoys a relaxing day drawing, practicing a foreign language, and napping. Due to her own study's findings, she is also picking up on her labmates' gym-going habit (slowly but surely).
