I joined the CoBrA lab in January 2017, as a Masterâ€™s student in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience at McGill University. I am jointly supervised by Dr. Marie Brossard-Racine and Dr. Mallar Chakravarty. I am currently investigating neurodevelopment in adolescents born with a congenital heart defect. I am particularly interested in using advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging techniques to study white matter organization.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy sports, monkeys and discovering new restaurants.
