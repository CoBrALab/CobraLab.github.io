Tristin joined the CoBrA lab in August 2020 as a master’s student in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience at McGill University 
and is co-supervised by Dr. Simon Ducharme. 

He holds a Bachelor of Science in Behavioural Neuroscience from Concordia University. His undergraduate honours thesis examined the 
electrophysiological correlates of bilingual speech processing in older adults.

During his master’s, Tristin will be examining the role of the cerebellum in disease progression and symptomatology in genetic Frontotemporal Dementia.

Outside the lab, you can find him riding his bike and taking long walks with his Mitsou, his dog.
