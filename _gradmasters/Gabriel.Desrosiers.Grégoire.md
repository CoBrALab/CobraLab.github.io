I am an undergraduate student in the program of neuroscience at McGill and I joined the CoBrA lab in September 2017 to pursue my last year research project under the supervision of Dr. Chakravarty.
A strong immune response during pregnancy is recognized as a substantial risk factor for the child to develop mental illness later in life. My research project aims at studying the impact of maternal immune activation during gestation on the neuroanatomy of the embryonic brain, and how it can lead to the development of major mental illness later in life. Establishing how early prenatal insults on the developing brain can give rise to mental illnesses will help identify key neurodevelopmental processes and brain functions relevant to these disorders, and eventually improve treatment approaches and outcomes.
Outside of the lab, in terms of sports, I like running and hiking. I also highly enjoy coffee and music.
