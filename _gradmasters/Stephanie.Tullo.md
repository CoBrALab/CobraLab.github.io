Stephanie joined the CoBrA lab in May 2015 as an undergraduate student in Neuroscience. She is currently a MSc candidate in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience (IPN) at McGill University. Her research interests include the influence of various factors, such as environmental influences or genetic factors, on brain structure and behaviour, as well as the cytopathology of neurodegenerative disorders and its effects on brain anatomy using neuroimaging techniques. She is currently working on improving automated segmentation accuracy of the basal ganglia and thalamus (using MAGeTbrain) to investigate the relationship between age and subcortical morphology across the healthy adult lifespan, and to study the implications in neuropsychiatric disorders in which these subcortical structures are heavily implicated, such as in Parkinsonâ€™s disease.
