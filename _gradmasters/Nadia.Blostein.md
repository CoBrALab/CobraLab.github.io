Nadia joined the lab in September 2018 to study the heritability of subcortical structures 
(extension of Dr. Sejal Patelâ€™s work on the heritability of the hippocampus).
She completed her undergraduate studies in Cognitive Science at McGill University in Winter 2020. 

She is currently a Master student in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience at McGill University. She is 
examining the evolution of subcortical structure shape across the phylogenetic tree. 

When she is not scouting for non human primate brains, she can be found camouflaged under a pile of comic books.
