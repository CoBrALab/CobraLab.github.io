I joined the Cobra Lab during the winter of 2015. I am a MSc. Candidate with McGillâ€™s Integrated Program in Neuroscience (IPN), jointly supervised by Dr. Suzanne King and Dr. Mallar Chakravarty. Currently, my work is focused on structural neuroanatomical effects associated with natural disaster related prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) exposure.

I completed a BA. and a BSc. at the University of New Brunswick. Where I also worked as a research assistant studying the effects of methylphenidate (Ritalin) on memory.
