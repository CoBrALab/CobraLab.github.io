The [BEaST tools](http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesSoftwareAdvancedImageProcessingTools/BEaST) are designed to extract brains from a full MRI scan[1], it was developed at the McConnell Brain Imaging Centre.
Full step-by-step instructions on how to use BEaST are [available on our wiki page](https://github.com/CobraLab/documentation/wiki/How-to-run-BEaST).
The [BEaST bpipe package](https://github.com/CobraLab/mincbeast_bpipe) is an experimental implementation developed by CoBrA Lab which uses [bpipe](https://code.google.com/p/bpipe/) to provide parallelization and scheduler system integration for the BEaST tools.
