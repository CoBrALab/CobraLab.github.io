I am currently a M.Sc. candidate in the Cobra Lab.  Prior to entering the Integrated Neuroscience (IPN) Program at McGill University, I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto specializing in Neuroscience and majoring in both Cell/Molecular Biology and Psychology.  My continued interests in the cross-disciplinary study of memory lead to my involvement in projects focusing on structure-molecular (MRI) and structure-function relationships (fMRI) within the context of health and disease.  Throughout my undergraduate degree I became involved in studies assessing the neuroanatomy of the Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL) including the hippocampus and its subfields.  Currently, in the Cobra Lab, I am focusing on the neuroanatomical study of the white matter of the MTL (the main output pathways form the hippocampus) within different disease populations. In addition to a whole host of other projects, I am also involved in a study aiming to identify if any plastic changes occur during Alzheimerâ€™s disease Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) treatment.
