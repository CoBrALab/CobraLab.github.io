title: The CoBrA Lab would like to welcome Hanna Röhling as a student intern in our lab!
---
Hanna Röhling is a second year student of the Master program in Computational Neuroscience at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience in Berlin, Germany. Having completed her undergraduate studies in Computational Life Science at the University of Lübeck in Germany, Hanna became interested in machine learning and multi-variate techniques for the development of diagnostic tools and the investigation of biomarkers. She would like to gain experience in a more translationally oriented research field and will be doing a lab rotation at the CoBrA Lab for three months to gain experience in computational neuroanatomy. Specifically, during her time with us, Hanna will examine the genetic underpinnings of patterns of regional differences in cortical thickness on a schizophrenia dataset (NUSDAST) for which she will analyze the transcriptomic profiles from multiple sites of the brain (such as the Allen Institute Human Brain Atlas) to see whether the gene expression patterns reflect the differential cortical thickness patterns.
