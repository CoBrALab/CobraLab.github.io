title: Congratulations to Alexandra on receiving a M.Eng. in Biomedical Engineering
---

The CoBrA lab would like to congratulate Alexandra on graduating with a degree of M.Eng. in Biomedical Engineering from the Biological and Biomedical Engineering Program from McGill University!

Alexandra completed her master's thesis entitled "Discriminating between schizophrenia subtypes using clustering and supervised learning" in June 2018. For her Master's, Alex aimed to characterize the heterogeneity in a schizophrenia population by deriving subgroups from clinical data, and predict individual clinical profiles from neuroanatomical measures using machine learning techniques. 

Alex is currently looking for opportunities where she can continue to explore data mining and machine learning. The CoBrA lab wishes her the best of luck in her future endeavours!
