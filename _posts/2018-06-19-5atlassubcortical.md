title: New MAGeT-Brain Atlases available for the Striatum, Globus Pallidus and Thalamus
---

New atlases of the striatum, globus pallidus and thalamus has been created and are available for the [MAGeT-Brain automated segmentation pipeline](https://github.com/CobraLab/MAGeTbrain). Previously, segmentation of the striatum, globus pallidus and thalamus were generated from a single high-resolution and -contrast MRI atlas derived from annotated serial histological sections. However, in an effort to consolidate and improve the workflow of our segmentation pipeline, the creation and use of these five atlases of the striatum, globus pallidus and thalamus, along with three-dimensional surface rendering of these structures, will serve as a new set of priors for input. The creation of these atlases served to homogenize the MAGeT-Brain input atlases, allowing for simultaneous multi-structure segmentation of these subcortical structures along with the hippocampal subfields and white matter, and the cerebellum.

These atlases are available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/CobraLab/atlases/tree/master/5-atlas-subcortical) and are also available on our [Figshare repository](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4052768).
