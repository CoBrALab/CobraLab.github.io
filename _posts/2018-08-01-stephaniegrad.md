title: Congratulations to Stephanie on graduating from the IPN program with a M.Sc. in Neuroscience!
---

The CoBrA lab would like to congratulate Stephanie on graduating with a degree of M.Sc. in Neuroscience from the Integrated Program in Neuroscience from McGill University!

As part of her Master’s, Stephanie investigated the normative relationships between age and subcortical morphology and microstructure across the healthy adult lifespan by first improving upon an existing automated segmentation pipeline, MAGeTbrain, through the [creation of five high-resolution input atlases of the striatum, globus pallidus and thalamus](http://cobralab.ca/atlases/5atlas-subcortical) ([see Tullo et al., (2018) for more information about the atlas creation)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018107).

In addition to completing her Master's thesis entitled "Mapping age-related effects on the striatum, globus pallidus and thalamus in healthy individuals across the adult lifespan", Stephanie was also involved in various projects during her time at the CoBrA lab. Specifically, she was involved in recruitment and data collection of two human studies, [“Effects of normal and healthy aging on hippocampal subfield anatomy”](http://cobralab.ca/projects/healthy-aging/), and [“High-resolution MRI-based biomarkers for identifying risk for Alzheimer's disease”](http://cobralab.ca/projects/adbiomarkers/). 

Stephanie will be commencing her Ph.D. studies with the CoBrA Lab in September, where she will work on models of Parkinson’s disease.
