---

The CoBrA lab would like to congratulate Rob on graduating with a degree of M.Sc. in Neuroscience from the Integrated Program in Neuroscience with a 4.0 average GPA from McGill University!

In addition to completing his master's thesis entitled "The human memory circuit: methodological development, validation, and implementation for the complete volumetric assessment of extra-hippocampal white matter and subfield structures in healthy and pathological aging", Rob was also involved in various projects during his time at the CoBrA lab. Specifically, he was involved in the volumetric investigation for [ADvance Alzheimer's deep brain stimulation trial] (http://www.fxneuromod.com/advance_study/index.php), the investigation of neuroanatomical structural changes in depression, the generation of harmonized hippocampal subfield segmentation protocol with [Hippocampal Subfield Segmentation Group] (http://www.hippocampalsubfields.com/), and the development of segmentation protocol for the Medial Temporal Lobe cortices.

Outside of the lab, Rob was recruited as a member of McGill University Pharmacology and Therapeutics Cyclic Review Board, a member of 3 Minute Thesis Board, Brain Reach Program, Post Graduate Student Society (PGSS), Neuroscience Graduate Student Mentorship Program, and Basic Business Skills for Scientists.

He is currently looking for opportunities in Ontario's Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Industry sectors while also simultaneously working on building his own Contract Research Organization for analysis of structural neuroimaging data called, [Cerebrometrix] (www.cerebrometrix.com).

The CoBrA lab would like to wish Rob the best of luck in his future endeavours!
