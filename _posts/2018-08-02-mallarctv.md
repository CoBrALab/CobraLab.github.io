title: Detecting Alzheimer's disease early using Artificial intelligence
---

While standard MRI allows us to see advanced Alzheimer's disease, such as atrophy of the hippocampus, detecting subtle alterations in the brain occuring long before people start experiencing confusion and memory loss is crucial in order to detect and diagnose the disease long before itâ€™s too late. With the use of artificial intelligence however, trained computer algorithms can detect patterns across MRI images to recognize these changes early and identify patients at risk of developing this disease.

Check out the video below where Dr. Mallar Chakravarty explains artificial intelligence (AI) and shares recent research from our group in which describes how AI can help with the early detection and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.
