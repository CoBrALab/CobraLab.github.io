title: Congratulations to Sejal on receiving a Ph.D. in Neurogenetics!
---

The CoBrA lab would like to congratulate Sejal on graduating with a degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Neurogenetics from the Institute of Medical Science of University of Toronto!

Sejal completed her doctoral thesis entitled "Integrating Neuroimaging and Genetics Data in a Bioinformatics-Based Approach for the Study of Alzheimer’s Disease" in January 2019. Her work focused on integrating existing tools to prioritize influential genetic variants and associated neuroanatomical measures in order to tease apart the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease and be able to use these markers in a predictive analysis of Alzheimer’s Disease progression.  
 
Sejal will be starting a post-doc with Dr. Leon French at Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. With Dr. French, she will be taking a neuroanatomical focus in integrating methods for drug enrichment and discovery from depression genome wide association results using existing transcriptomic datasets. In addition, identifying potential brain regions and cell types for targeted therapies in major depressive disorder and applying these methods to other complex brain disorders such as anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia. 

The CoBrA lab wishes her the best of luck in her future endeavours!
