The CoBrA Lab returned to Camp Kanawana for their fourth annual lab retreat. Thanks to the unseasonably warm weather, after our daily meetings reviewing our accomplishments of the past year and brainstorming future directions for our laboratory, we spent most of our days lakeside, canoeing, kayaking, and paddle boarding. This retreat provides a great opportunity to reflect upon the last academic year, and re-energize for the new year, with our yearly fix of sâ€™mores, and exciting new upcoming projects.
