title: Camp Cobra 2016!
---

The Cobra Lab returned to Camp Kanawana for their second annual lab retreat. We spent the three days lakeside, canoeing, kayaking, and paddle boarding. Waking up to the beautiful sounds of nature and starting the day off with lakeside morning yoga, then huddling by the campfire at night and stuffing our faces with s'mores was the epitome of our trip. However, it wasn't all fun and games. We had daily meetings reviewing our accomplishments of the past year and brainstorming future directions for our laboratory.
