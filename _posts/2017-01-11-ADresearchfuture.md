There is more reason to feel hopeful about future prospects for Alzheimer’s disease treatment and prevention as research continues to yield important new insights about the disease. 2016 saw key breakthroughs and trends in the fight against Alzheimer’s, however there is still so much about this disease that is still unknown.

Check out the article [10 Reasons to Be Hopeful About the Future of Alzheimer’s Disease](https://www.caring.com/articles/alzheimers-research-2016) which summarises this past year's research findings, initiatives and information on treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.
