The CoBrA lab would like to congratulate fellow member Mila Urosevic on winning third place for best poster presentation at the 2018 Undergraduate Research Expo of the Douglas Institute Research Centre. Mila presented her work titled, “Investigating the effects of diet and exercise in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease”. Mila presented data on her summer project examining the impact of diet and exercise interventions (using new dimensionality reduction techniques) on performance in Alzheimer’s disease related behaviours in the 3xTg mouse model.

Congratulations to the other winners, and to all students who presented!
