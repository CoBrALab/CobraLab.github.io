title: We’re going to SfN's 45th annual meeting in Chicago!
---

The Cobra Lab will be at the Society for Neuroscience’s 45th annual meeting in Chicago from October 17-21. The meeting is “the premier venue for neuroscientists to present emerging science, learn from experts, forge collaborations with peers, explore new tools and technologies, and advance careers.” The 4-day event is the world’s largest meeting in neuroscience, with over 30,000 attendees from around the globe. Five of our lab members will be presenting posters and our very own Dr. Gabriel Devenyi will be giving a talk on his work on structural trajectories of healthy aging in cortical thickness and subcortical morphometry.
