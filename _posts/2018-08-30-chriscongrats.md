The CoBrA lab would like to congratulate Dr. Christopher Steele on becoming a new Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology, Concordia University. During his post-doctoral fellowship at the CoBrA Lab, Chris worked on examining cerebellar anatomy and cerebellar and cerebello-cortical connectivity and its heritability. We look forward to watching Chris build his team and his research program!
