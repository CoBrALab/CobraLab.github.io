The CoBrA Lab will be at the Organization for Human Brain Mappingâ€™s annual meeting in Vancouver from June 25-29. The Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) is the primary international organization dedicated to using neuroimaging to discover the organization of the human brain, and their annual meeting brings together researchers in the field of neuroimaging to share their visions, knowledge, and experience through exceptional scientific sessions, poster presentations and networking forums that allows attendees to remain at the cutting edge of neuroimaging research.

Matt Park, Nikhil Bhagwat, and Raihaan Patel will each be presenting posters. Search for their abstracts [here](https://ww5.aievolution.com/hbm1701/index.cfm?do=abs.pubSearchAbstracts).
