title: Camp CoBrA 2017!
---

The CoBrA Lab returned to Camp Kanawana for our third annual lab retreat. We spent the three days lakeside reviewing our accomplishments of the past year and brainstorming future directions for our laboratory. It was not all work and no play. Despite the weather, we had a wonderful time hiking, kayaking and canoeing, and ended each day huddling by the campfire while stuffing our faces with sâ€™mores and playing campfire games.
