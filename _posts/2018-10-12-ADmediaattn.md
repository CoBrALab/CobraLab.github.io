title: Predicting Alzheimer's Disease
---

Check out the following articles (from The London Telegraph, UK express, and Radio-Canada) describing recent research from our group, where a Artificial Intelligence algorithm can detect patterns across MRI images, genetics, and cognitive data to recognize changes in cognition that may be putting individuals on the path towards Alzheimer’s disease. We are very proud of the attention that this important work by Nikhil Bhagwat et al. is receiving!
