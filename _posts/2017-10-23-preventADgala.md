The CoBrA lab attended this year's Centre for Studies on Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (StoP-AD Centre) annual gala. The StoP-AD Centre is a joint collaboration between McGill University and the Douglas Institute which is dedicated to the prevention of AD. Specifically, the PREVENT-Alzheimer program studies Alzheimer’s disease in its pre-symptomatic stages in the hopes of finding strategies that can slow or reverse brain changes that may occur in older people who do not suffer from dementia but have a parental history of Alzheimer’s disease. 
 
As a collaborating investigator, Dr. Mallar Chakravarty attended the annual gala along with the CoBrA lab members working on the [Alzheimer's Disease Biomarker study](http://cobralab.ca/projects/adbiomarkers/). We were pleased to have been a part of the day's events which thanked the participants for dedicating their time to help Alzheimer's research.
