title: Congratulations to Nikhil on receiving a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering!
---

The CoBrA lab would like to congratulate Nikhil on graduating with a degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biomedical Engineering from the institute of Biomaterials & Biomedical Engineering of University of Toronto!

Nikhil completed his doctoral thesis entitled "Prognostic Applications for Alzheimer's Disease Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Machine-learning" in August 2018. His work, particularly pertaining to development of an artificial intelligence algorithm to predict an individual’s cognitive decline leading to Alzheimer’s disease, has received a lot of media attention ([articles from The London Telegraph, UK express, and Radio-Canada](http://cobralab.ca/2018/10/12/ADmediaattn/), [Global News](http://cobralab.ca/2018/10/25/mallarglobal/), [Scientifica](http://cobralab.ca/2018/11/02/scientificafeature/))
 
Nikhil will be starting a joint post-doc with Dr. Louis Collins, and Dr. Jean-Baptiste Poline at the MNI, McGill, working on two research domains. With Dr. Collins, he will be working on longitudinal characterization and prediction of neurodegenerative diseases using MRI and machine-learning. With Dr. Poline, he will be working on development of robust and scalable neuroinformatics tools to address reproducibility issues within current research practices.
